0	GameSE_abstract	Casanova: A simple, high-performance language for game development	"Managing the flow of time and the coordination of multiple components in games (and other highly interactive applications) is a challenging task. Therefore game development requires a lot of effort, even for (apparently) simple scenarios. To reduce the cost and effort of game development, we designed a new computer language called ""Casanova 2"". Using a case study, we demonstrate that Casanova 2 can be used to implement typical game scenario's using functional programming constructs. Our evaluation shows that it has both a high performance and a high usability."

1	GameSE_abstract	Early usability in model-driven game development	Video games are one of the most influential types of software today. However, they are becoming more and more complex to design and evaluate. In this context, Model-Driven Development approaches seem to be very promising since a video game can be obtained by transforming platform-independent models into platform-specific models that can be in turn transformed into code. In previous work, we defined a usability evaluation method specifically tailored to this type of development process. This paper shows how this method can be used to evaluate the usability of video games in early stages of a model-driven development process. The method relies on a model that decomposes usability into measurable attributes and metrics specific for the video game domain. To show the feasibility of the method, we performed an early usability evaluation of a video game for the XBOX360 platform.

2	GameSE_abstract	Shopping for Game levels: A Visual Analytics Approach to Exploring Procedurally Generated Content	Procedural content generation techniques can be used during game design to aid in exploration and expedite the content creation process. But this comes with the challenge of exploring a large quantity of generated content. This challenge is exacerbated by the lack of proper supporting tools. We contend that such tools should encourage exploration, and respect the nature of design judgment. We present a visual analytics tool, DesignSense, developed as a response to a similar challenge in the architectural design domain. In a case study, we applied DesignSense to a dataset of generated levels for a puzzle game. The initial observations suggest a match between the task described and the features present in DesignSense with room for improvement concerning its integration with the game development process.

3	GameSE_abstract	Adding variety in NPCs behaviour using emotional states and genetic algorithms: The GENIE project	In recent years we have been observing an increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in video games. With the increasing availability of powerful hardware and advanced algorithms, we can now scale up the quality of the AI available to every Non Playing Character (NPC). Despite this increased quality, every NPC can get predictable with time and game designers are struggling to provide variety in games where many NPCs are present. Designing a specific, and unique, AI for every NPC can be a very time and resource consuming task. In this paper we propose GENIE (Genes Driven Decision Tree) as a tool to support game designers in the creation of a wide variety of behaviours. With GENIE, it is possible to define an NPC behaviour in term of internal parameters representing its state.

4	GameSE_abstract	How to launch a successful video game: A framework	Launching a successful video game is crucial for any video game developer given a competitive nature of a video game industry. A successful video game can guarantee the continuity of some companies, and their plans in the industry. On the other hand, a video game that does not generate enough sales may bring the business down. An extensive review of the literature on video game and the published frameworks was performed. The results show that existing frameworks only considered limited aspects of game development. Therefore, this paper proposes a holistic framework that covers every aspect of video game development. The framework discusses the pre-launch processes such as concept design, development budget, game engines and the post-launch aspects of marketing, multiplayer, and downloadable content. It also looks at the external forces and how they affect the internal pre and post launch processes. Finally, the proposed framework is applied to Duke Nukem Forever, a video game that was released in 2011 after fifteen years of development.

5	GameSE_abstract	Open source computer game application: An empirical analysis of quality concerns	A computer game is one of the major sources of entertainment. People nowadays spend a lot of time while playing computer games. Open Source Software (OSS), despite some reservations on the quality, has been steadily increasing its popularity. The uncontrolled change management foresees an increase in the complexity of the methods and classes in an application, which sometimes result in poor quality. The number of OSS projects dealing with computer game development are on the increase, which lead to more research interests in assessing the quality of OSS resulting products. Some studies that deal with the evaluating the OSS quality, concerns use user's survey approach focusing on the usability aspects. The empirical investigations to evaluate the quality concerns of the design, using internal code attributes, needs attention of researchers. In this study, we aim to investigate the quality concerns of the design complexity of methods in OSS computer game applications using internal code attributes. We use three quality criteria, namely correctness, reliability and maintainability from the set of six factors of ISO 9126 model. We collect data from 55 OSS computer game applications and use various statistical analysis techniques to examine the research question of this study. We conclude that the methods of the OSS computer game applications demonstrate an acceptable level of quality in the three criteria of correctness, reliability and maintainability.

6	GameSE_abstract	Comparative API complexity analysis of two platforms for networked multiplayer games using a reference game	In this paper we propose the quantitative analysis of the complexity of a simple reference game implemented on a particular gaming platform as means for characterizing how the platform succeeds in easing the development of networked multiplayer games. We first present our own open source tool based on Sneed's Object-Point (OP) method for the automatic quantitative assessment of the complexity of a software API by analyzing a source code using the API. We then apply our tool, together with the recently released JSComplexity tool based on classical software complexity metrics, to compare two platforms for networked multiplayer games, the open source realXtend Tundra SDK and the proprietary Union. As the reference games we use existing implementations of the simple Pong game atop the two platforms. Our data shows that these complexity metrics reveal API design tradeoffs, resulting in complexity differences in the reference games.

7	GameSE_abstract	Video Game Automated Testing Approaches: An Assessment Framework	The video-game industry has recently grown from focused markets to mainstream. The advancements the industry has been enjoying motivated researchers to propose techniques and tools to support the activities across the different phases of the game development lifecycle. Game testing is one of the crucial activities within the game development process. Due to the nature of game testing, many automated game testing techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, there is no framework that could be used to aid practitioners in selecting appropriate techniques suitable for their particular development efforts. In this article, we present an attribute-based framework to classify and compare these techniques and provide such aid to practitioners. The framework is also meant to guide researchers interested in proposing new game testing techniques. The article discusses a number of prominent techniques against the framework. Analysis of the discussion reveals gaps and suggests open points for future research.	Assessment framework; game development; game testing; playtesting; software testing	Albaghajati, A.; Ahmed, M.

8	GameSE_abstract	Arbiter work stealing for parallelizing games on heterogeneous computing environments	"Games are simulations of the physical and imaginary worlds. Games nowadays run on commodity platforms that include different categories of powerful computing elements with varying capabilities. To benefit from this variety, suitable mapping of works to computing elements is essential for optimal performance. Arbiter Work Stealing (AWS) is a new scheduler addressing this requirement. The AWS scheduler builds on the classical work stealing algorithm by adding an upper layer that ""manages"" multiple running instances of the work stealing algorithm. AWS automatically schedules the dynamically generated game application tasks to appropriate processors using a cost model that takes into account current work load, execution times, data locality, and data transfer rates. Experimental results show that incorporating AWS to schedule tasks of a parallel game application yields superior performance through better utilization of the available resources and through better use of data locality in a heterogeneous computing environment."

9	GameSE_abstract	A Digital Game Maturity Model	Game development is an interdisciplinary concept that embraces artistic, software engineering, management, and business disciplines. This research facilitates a better understanding of important dimensions of digital game development methodology. Game development is considered as one of the most complex tasks in software engineering. The increased popularity of digital games, the challenges faced by game development organizations in developing quality games, and high competition in the digital game industry demand a game development maturity assessment. Consequently, this study presents a Digital Game Maturity Model to evaluate the current development methodology in an organization. The framework of this model consists of assessment questionnaires, a performance scale, and a rating method. The main goal of the questionnaires is to collect information about current processes and practices. In general, this research contributes towards formulating a comprehensive and unified strategy for game development maturity evaluation. Two case studies were conducted and their assessment results reported. These demonstrate the level of maturity of current development practices in two organizations.

10	GameSE_abstract	An inclusive framework for developing a car racing simulator game using artificial intelligence techniques and usability principles	Computer games have become one of the most significant digital applications due to the rapid improvement of software industry. Developers create computer games based on a combination of interleaving elements that contain technical and artistic aspects. Therefore, games development needs a comprehensive ideal path including different design considerations and usability issues than other typical software. In this research, we illustrate the general framework that helps developers to develop effective interactive games with an example of our developed contemporary computer game called Race for Freedom which was inspired by the Death Race film's story. The most significance game development challenges addressed in this research is adapting artificial intelligence techniques in the implementation phase and validating the usability of developed game in the evaluation phase.

11	GameSE_abstract	Evaluation of graphical user interfaces guidelines for virtual reality games	Virtual Reality presents a new form of human-computer interaction for the video game world, introducing new challenges for various aspects of game development. Many of the traditional practices in the design and development of Graphical User Interfaces do not fit the context of Virtual Reality (VR), requiring adaptations or the creation of new solutions. This work proposes to analyze some of the GUI guidelines for VR, and from this, investigate the perception of players about the GUI guidelines. An analysis of some of the manufacturers and game engine guidelines for VR was carried out with the purpose of identifying which recommendations are more common. After that, a survey was applied with players to define, from the perspective of the user, the level of importance of each guideline. In addition to the analysis of the users' perspective, a set of games has been chosen and analyzed to understand the game's compliance with the guidelines. The results of the analysis showed that the games are respecting the guidelines, but users still perceive some issues with the VR games GUIs.

12	GameSE_abstract	Formal Procedural Content Generation in games driven by social analyses	Millions of people play online computer games every day. Massive Multiplay Online (MMO) Games suffer a great problem: Developing new content for games (especially for Role Play Games-RPG) is an highly expensive and time consuming task. On the other hand, Players usually complain of static and repetitive contents of games and a rapid decrease of their interest in the games is evident after main patches deployment. In this scenario, a way to create new dynamic game contents is appealing, in particular if it depends on players needs and expectations. In this paper we describe a framework and a methodology for Procedural Content Generation (PCG) of game contents. The methodology exploit formal Multi-Agent based models and planning techniques.

In order to achieve this goal we conducted an empirical study on java open source games. More specifically, we examined several successful open source games, identified the number of defects, the debugging rate and performed design pattern related measurements. The results of the study suggest that the overall number of design pattern instances is not correlated to defect frequency and debugging effectiveness. However, specific design patterns appear to have a significant impact on the number of reported bugs and debugging rate.	computer games; design patterns; empirical study; software defects	Ampatzoglou, A.; Kritikos, A.; Arvanitou, E.-M.; Gortzis, A.; Chatziasimidis, F.; Stamelos, I.

15	GameSE_abstract	Tight Integration of Rule-Based Tools in Game Development	In the wider perspective of narrowing down some of the gaps that prevent the adoption of declarative logic programming within highly dynamically changing environments, we focus in this paper on the context of integrating reasoning modules in real-time videogames. Integrating rule-based AI within the commercial game development life-cycle poses a number of unsolved challenges, each with non-obvious solution. For instance, it is necessary to cope with strict time performance requirements; the duality between procedural code and declarative specifications prevents easy integration; the concurrent execution of reasoning tasks and game updates requires proper information passing strategies between the two involved sides. In this work we illustrate our recent progress on how to embed rule-based reasoning modules into the well-known Unity game development engine. To this end, we report about ThinkEngine, a framework in which a tight integration of declarative formalisms within the typical game development workflow is made possible. We prove the viability of our approach by developing a proof-of-concept Unity game that makes use of ASP-based AI modules.

17	GameSE_abstract	Enhancing the Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm for Video Game Testing	In this paper, we study the effects of several Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) modifications for video game testing. Although MCTS modifications are highly studied in game playing, their impacts on finding bugs are blank. We focused on bug finding in our previous study where we introduced synthetic and human-like test goals and we used these test goals in Sarsa and MCTS agents to find bugs. In this study, we extend the MCTS agent with several modifications for game testing purposes. Furthermore, we present a novel tree reuse strategy. We experiment with these modifications by testing them on three testbed games, four levels each, that contain 45 bugs in total. We use the General Video Game Artificial Intelligence (GVG-AI) framework to create the testbed games and collect 427 human tester trajectories using the GVG-AI framework. We analyze the proposed modifications in three parts: we evaluate their effects on bug finding performances of agents, we measure their success under two different computational budgets, and we assess their effects on human-likeness of the human-like agent. Our results show that MCTS modifications improve the bug finding performance of the agents.	Game Testing; Monte Carlo Tree Search	Ariyurek, S.; Betin-Can, A.; Surer, E.

18	GameSE_abstract	Automated Video Game Testing Using Synthetic and Humanlike Agents	In this article, we present a new methodology that employs tester agents to automate video game testing. We introduce two types of agents - synthetic and humanlike - and two distinct approaches to create them. Our agents are derived from Sarsa and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) but focus on finding defects, while traditional game-playing agents focus on maximizing game scores. The synthetic agent uses test goals generated from game scenarios, and these goals are further modified to examine the effects of unintended game transitions. The humanlike agent uses test goals extracted by our proposed multiple greedy-policy inverse reinforcement learning (MGP-IRL) algorithm from tester trajectories. MGP-IRL captures multiple policies executed by human testers. We use our agents to produce test sequences, and run the game with these sequences. At each run, we use an automated test oracle to check for bugs. We analyze the proposed method in two parts - we compare the success of humanlike and synthetic agents in bug finding, and we evaluate the similarity between humanlike agents and human testers. We collected 427 trajectories from human testers using the General Video Game Artificial Intelligence (GVG-AI) framework and created three games with 12 levels that contain 45 bugs. Our experiments reveal that humanlike and synthetic agents compete with human testers' bug finding performances. Moreover, we show that MGP-IRL increases the humanlikeness of agents while improving the bug finding performance.

19	GameSE_abstract	Learning to select mates in evolving non-playable characters	Procedural content generation (PCG) is an active area of research with the potential to significantly reduce game development costs as well as create game experiences meaningfully personalized to each player. Evolutionary methods are a promising method of generating content procedurally. In particular asynchronous evolution of AI agents in an artificial life (A-life) setting is notably similar to the online evolution of non-playable characters in a video game. In this paper, we are concerned with improving the efficiency of evolution via more effective mate selection. In the spirit of PCG, we genetically encode each agent's preference for mating partners and thereby allowing the mate-selection process to evolve. We evaluate this approach in a simple predator-prey A-life environment and demonstrate that the ability to evolve a per-agent mate-selection preference function indeed significantly increases the extinction time of the population. Additionally, an inspection of the evolved preference function parameters shows that agents evolve to favor mates who have survival traits.

20	GameSE_abstract	LeGACy Code: Studying How	How did game programmers use early game development tools, and how does this fit into the bigger picture of how humans use tools and technology? To help answer these questions, we embark on an interdisciplinary collaboration between archaeology and computer science. Graphic Adventure Creator (GAC) was released in the mid-1980s for a number of microcomputers; we focus here on the 1986 version for the ZX Spectrum, a popular UK computer of that era. GAC was a game-development tool for creating text adventure games, optionally with graphic images. We have amassed a corpus of nearly all known GAC-produced games for the Spectrum-over 130-and reverse-engineered the game format. We extracted out all the games' data, and built a software framework to perform static and dynamic analysis of all these games at scale. This empirical data, plus contextual information from some interviews we conducted, gives us unique insight into the nature of how this tool was used to make games.	archaeogaming; binary reverse engineering; empirical study; game development; Graphic Adventure Creator; text adventure	Aycock, J.; Biittner, K.

21	GameSE_abstract	A Formal Model of Patrolling Game and its Agent-Based Simulation Using Jason	This paper introduces a simple generalized formal model for patrolling games that is suitable for decision making regarding the efficient use of scarce resources in surveillance applications. The model is then mapped to a multi-Agent simulation using Jason agent oriented programming language. We present the details of the multi-Agent model of the game, as well as experimental results that we obtained by simulating a sample patrolling game. The main contribution of the paper is the mapping of the formal game model, as inspired by game theory, to the more practical agent-oriented programming approach, as advocated by agent-oriented software engineering.	agent-based computing; security game; simulation	Badica, A.; Badica, C.; Sitnikov, C.; Leon, F.

22	GameSE_abstract	A framework to create conversational agents for the development of video games by end-users	Video game development is still a difficult task today, requiring strong programming skills and knowledge of multiple technologies. To tackle this problem, some visual tools such as Unity or Unreal have appeared. These tools are effective and easy to use, but they are not entirely aimed at end-users with little knowledge of software engineering. Currently, there is a resurgence in the use of chatbots thanks to the recent advances in fields such as artificial intelligence or language processing. However, there is no evidence about the use of conversational agents for developing video games with domain-specific languages (DSLs). This work states the following two hypotheses: (i) Conversational agents based on natural language can be used to work with DSL for the creation of video games; (ii) these conversational agents can be automatically created by extracting the concepts, properties and relationships from their abstract syntax. To demonstrate the hypotheses, we propose and detail the implementation of a framework to work with DSLs through a chatbot, its implementation details and a systematic method to automate its construction. This approach could be also suitable for other disciplines, in addition to video games development.

23	GameSE_abstract	A framework for integrating software design patterns with game design framework	Object oriented design patterns (DP) are meant to provide a common structure for solving common software development problems. Applying those patterns is expected to improve the software systems maintainability, comprehensibility, and provide a common language for developers to understand and effectively communicate. However, this was not always the case, where some studies have shown that using design patterns may lead to a system harder to maintain and understand and more error prone; as compared to same systems without the use of design patterns. This variation is referred to the features of the system on hand, and the experience of the developers who are capable to know what design patterns to use and when. Considering the video game development, the use of software design pattern is still at low scale, and still; there is no recipe on what and when to use design patterns. In the meantime, there are different game design frameworks that define different aspects which need to be considered when developing a game. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates some creational and behavioral DP, with a specific game design framework. In this way, we claim that the developers will have some hints on what DP to use with the main game aspects. This framework is suitable for games which can be developed after the first course of game design, regardless of the game engine used for development. The framework can be extended with more DP, for larger scale and more sophisticated game.	Game design frameworks; Software maintainability; Software O.O Design patterns; Video games	Barakat, N.H.

25	GameSE_abstract	First Time User Experiences in mobile games: An evaluation of usability	Unlike most other mobile applications, games are driven by their user experience rather than their functionality. No one wishes to play games that are either frustrating or difficult for the wrong reasons. Usability is an integral part of software development and is about maximizing the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction of the user. The delicacy of the user experience and heavy competition it can be argued render usability more important in games than it is in other software. Immersion and engagement are fundamental and core parts of the enjoyment of computer games, and both are dependent on usability. The focus of this article is around a framework for evaluating the usability of First Time User Experiences (FTUEs). Investigating two specific, off-the-shelf games, we demonstrate that the FTUE can affect an element of usability, namely 'information quality' when controlling for the guidance and information presented. Despite this, overall usability is unaffected by the presence of the FTUE.	First Time User Experience (FTUE); Game design; Usability	Barnett, L.; Harvey, C.; Gatzidis, C.

A WorkFlow net is used to represent the activities the player will perform in a video game.

A timed version of the WorkFlow net (that models the activities of the game) and of the State Graph (that models the topological map of the game) is presented in order to produce an estimated time that corresponds to the effective duration a player will need to complete a specific level of a game. The simulation software CPN Tools is used to simulate both models and show, through a kind of quantitative analysis, the influence that one model has over the other.

28	GameSE_abstract	Formal approach based on petri nets for modeling and verification of video games	Video games are complex systems that combine technical and artistic processes. The specification of this type of system is not a trivial task, making it necessary to use diagrams and charts to visually specify sets of requirements. Therefore, the underlying proposal of this work is to present an approach based on the formalism of Petri nets for aiding in the design process of video games. The activities of the game are represented by a specific type of Petri net called Work- Flow net. The definition of a topological map can be represented by state graphs. Using Colored Petri nets, it is possible to define formal communication mechanisms between the model of activity and the model of the map. The simulation of the timed models allows then to produce an estimated time that corresponds to the effective duration a player will need to complete a level of a game. Furthermore, a kind of Soundness property related to gameplay in a game Quest can be verified through state space analysis. For a better understanding of the approach, the video game Silent Hill II is used.

29	GameSE_abstract	Size Estimation of Puzzle Games	Software game development industry is increasing day by day. Games development is different and more complicated than other software development models. This leads toward difficulty in the accurate estimation of size, cost and effort required for successful development of computer games. Many projects fail due to poor size estimation. In this research, we developed a model to estimate the size of puzzle games. This work is an extension of the board-games model for size estimation. Dataset used for this research is collected from open source code repositories. We analyzed the predictors already defined for the board-based size estimation model and identified a new predictor for size estimation of puzzle games. Applying SLR and MLR on the data set of puzzle games gave us promising results. The value of R2 obtained is 0.93. Results of validation of the model are MMRE 0.29, PRED (30) is 0.80. Using the K- fold cross validation, the model was validated using mathrm{K}=6. Results show that 4 out of 6 models have MMRE less than 0.30.	puzzle games; size estimation; software sizing	Bashir, F.; Sabahat, N.	2nd International Conference on Electrical, Communication and Computer Engineering, ICECCE 2020	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCE49384.2020.9179429				Included	Excluded	new_screen		Not related to Video Games: Studies that were not focused on software engineering applied to industry-scale computer games development.	2	Scopus	2020	Size Estimation Of Puzzle Games	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091935617&doi=10.1109%2fICECCE49384.2020.9179429&partnerID=40&md5=a0384fbfdd09f1801ddaf4160aec1996	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc	nan; Venue; References; Pages; Year; Bibtex

Recently, Intel released SGX, which can provide new security guarantees for software developers to achieve an unprecedented level of software integrity and confidentiality. To explore how SGX can protect a computer game in practice, in this paper we make a first step of exploring new ways to protect the integrity and confidentiality of game code and data, and in doing so we have developed a framework and design principles for integrating games with SGX. We have applied our framework to demonstrate how it can be used to protect a real world computer game.	Application security; Computer game protection; DRM; SGX	Bauman, E.; Lin, Z.

31	GameSE_abstract	Automated game balancing of asymmetric video games	Designing a (video) game such that it is balanced-i.e. fair for all players-is a prevailing challenge in game design. Perhaps counter-intuitively, games that are symmetric with respect to (board) design, starting conditions, and the employed action set, are not necessarily fair games. Indeed, perfect play from all players does not automatically lead to a draw, but may probabilistically favour e.g., the first player to move. Even more so, asymmetric games-in which the action set of one player is typically highly distinct from that of another player-are generally unbalanced unless meticulous care has been taken to ensure that the asymmetry in the design does not skew win probabilities. In this context, the present paper contributes a method for automatically balancing the design of asymmetric games. It employs Monte Carlo simulation to analyse the relative impact of game actions, and iteratively adjusts attributes of the game actions till the game design is balanced by approximation. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were performed with automatically balancing a set of tower-defence games. Preliminary experimental results revealed that the proposed method (1) is able to identify the principal component of a game's imbalance, and (2) can automatically adjust the game design till it is balanced by approximation.

33	GameSE_abstract	Towards a model to meet players' preferences in games	"Different have been the attempts to use Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning in game development. Among the others, some researchers have tried to adapt a game, or some part of it, to the user playing it. This approach has been called ""adaptive game design"". Contrarily to what it may seem, apparently the most interesting findings in this field have been made for drama managers, i.e. for the artificial intelligences that procedurally generate story flow. The paper takes the move from what seems to be a missing in current literature and it is aimed at proposing and discussing a possible procedural content generation via machine learning model that takes the latest approaches in machine learning applied to drama managers and combine them with findings from adaptive game design. The objective of the proposed model is to give players the best possible gaming experience of a highly branched game, depending on their attitudes towards the gaming world."

34	GameSE_abstract	Augmenting Automated Game Testing with Deep Reinforcement Learning	General game testing relies on the use of human play testers, play test scripting, and prior knowledge of areas of interest to produce relevant test data. Using deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we introduce a self-learning mechanism to the game testing framework. With DRL, the framework is capable of exploring and/or exploiting the game mechanics based on a user-defined, reinforcing reward signal. As a result, test coverage is increased and unintended game play mechanics, exploits and bugs are discovered in a multitude of game types. In this paper, we show that DRL can be used to increase test coverage, find exploits, test map difficulty, and to detect common problems that arise in the testing of first-person shooter (FPS) games.	automation; computer games; game testing; machine learning; reinforcement learning	Bergdahl, J.; Gordillo, C.; Tollmar, K.; Gisslen, L.

35	GameSE_abstract	Controlling First-Person Character Movement: A Low-Cost Camera-based Tracking Alternative for Virtual Reality	Virtual reality (VR) gaming is a billion-dollar industry that aims at providing a more realistic and exciting immersive experience in computer-simulated environment. Besides hardware capabilities and high-quality 3-D graphics, the feeling of immersion is augmented by incorporating realistic player-game interactions, including the control of game characters movements based on real/natural movements of the player and objects. To this intent, modern VR gaming usually leverages virtual reality headsets and additional devices/sensors whose costs are normally expensive for ordinary games users. In this paper, we propose a low-cost VR gaming system in which the smartphone is used as display and processing units, and its rear camera is used as the main sensor for controlling the character movements in a first-person shooter game (FPS) developed in this work. The VR game system can operate, on average, at 31 frames per second. Regarding the usability, 19 of 24 interviewed users evaluated the character movement precision as good or very good, while 95.8% considered the gun movement as good or very good. Also, all the users would recommend the movement control system as a real-virtual interaction alternative for VR gaming.

36	GameSE_abstract	Collection-focused parallelism	Constructing parallel software is, in essence, the process of associating 'work' with computational units. The definition of work is dependent upon the model of parallelism used, and our choice of model can have profound effects on both programmer productivity and run-time efficiency. Given that the movement of data is responsible for the majority of parallelism overhead, and accessing data is responsible for the majority of parallelism errors, data items should be the basis for describing parallel work. As data items rarely exist in isolation and are instead parts of larger collections, we argue that subsets of collections should be the basic unit of parallelism. This requires a semantically rich method of referring to these sub-collections. Sub-collections are not guaranteed to be disjoint, and so an efficient run-time mechanism is required to maintain correctness. With a focus on complex systems, we present some of the challenges inherent in this approach and describe how we are extending Synchronization via Scheduling (SvS) and other techniques to overcome these difficulties. We discuss our experiences incorporating these techniques into a modern video game engine used in an in-development title.

38	GameSE_abstract	SAGA: A DSL for story management	Video game development is currently a very labour-intensive endeavour. Furthermore it involves multi-disciplinary teams of artistic content creators and programmers, whose typical working patterns are not easily meshed. SAGA is our first effort at augmenting the productivity of such teams. Already convinced of the benefits of DSLs, we set out to analyze the domains present in games in order to find out which would be most amenable to the DSL approach. Based on previous work, we thus sought those sub-parts that already had a partially established vocabulary and at the same time could be well modeled using classical computer science structures. We settled on the 'story' aspect of video games as the best candidate domain, which can be modeled using state transition systems. As we are working with a specific company as the ultimate customer for this work, an additional requirement was that our DSL should produce code that can be used within a pre-existing framework. We developed a full system (SAGA) comprised of a parser for a human-friendly language for 'story events', an internal representation of design patterns for implementing object-oriented statetransitions systems, an instantiator for these patterns for a specific 'story', and three renderers (for C++, C# and Java) for the instantiated abstract code.

Modern computer technologies allow creating complex simulation games with multiple scenarios to be played. The objective of the research is to introduce an integrated approach for the game scenario generation, modeling and management that support simulation games' governance in line with the study course content.

40	GameSE_abstract	A fine-grained requirement traceability evolutionary algorithm: Kromaia, a commercial video game case study	Context:Commercial video games usually feature an extensive source code and requirements that are related to code lines from multiple methods. Traceability is vital in terms of maintenance and content update, so it is necessary to explore such search spaces properly. Objective:This work presents and evaluates CODFREL (Code Fragment-based Requirement Location), our approach to fine-grained requirement traceability, which lies in an evolutionary algorithm and includes encoding and genetic operators to manipulate code fragments that are built from source code lines. We compare it with a baseline approach (Regular-LSI) by configuring both approaches with different granularities (code lines / complete methods). Method:We evaluated our approach and Regular-LSI in the Kromaia video game case study, which is a commercial video game released on PC and PlayStation 4. The approaches are configured with method and code line granularity and work on 20 requirements that are provided by the development company. Our approach and Regular-LSI calculate similarities between requirements and code fragments or methods to propose possible solutions and, in the case of CODFREL, to guide the evolutionary algorithm. Results:The results, which compare code line and method granularity configurations of CODFREL with different granularity configurations of Regular-LSI, show that our approach outperforms Regular-LSI in precision and recall, with values that are 26 and 8 times better, respectively, even though it does not achieve the optimal solutions. We make an open-source implementation of CODFREL available. Conclusions:Since our approach takes into consideration key issues like the source code size in commercial video games and the requirement dispersion, it provides better starting points than Regular-LSI in the search for solution candidates for the requirements. However, the results and the influence of domain-specific language on them show that more explicit knowledge is required to improve such results.

41	GameSE_abstract	An evolutionary approach for generating software models: The case of Kromaia in Game Software Engineering	In the context of Model-Driven Engineering applied to video games, software models are high-level abstractions that represent source code implementations of varied content such as the stages of the game, vehicles, or enemy entities (e.g., final bosses). In this work, we present our Evolutionary Model Generation (EMoGen) approach to generate software models that are comparable in quality to the models created by human developers. Our approach is based on an evolution (mutation and crossover) and assessment cycle to generate the software models. We evaluated the software models generated by EMoGen in the Kromaia video game, which is a commercial video game released on Steam and PlayStation 4. Each model generated by EMoGen has more than 1000 model elements. The results, which compare the software models generated by our approach and those generated by the developers, show that our approach achieves results that are comparable to the ones created manually by the developers in the retail and digital versions of the video game case study. However, our approach only takes five hours of unattended time in comparison to ten months of work by the developers. We perform a statistical analysis, and we make an implementation of EMoGen readily available.

43	GameSE_abstract	MEnDiGa: A Minimal Engine for Digital Games	Game engines generate high dependence of developed games on provided implementation resources. Feature modeling is a technique that captures commonalities and variabilities results of domain analysis to provide a basis for automated configuration of concrete products. This paper presents the Minimal Engine for Digital Games (MEnDiGa), a simplified collection of game assets based on game features capable of building small and casual games regardless of their implementation resources. It presents minimal features in a representative hierarchy of spatial and game elements along with basic behaviors and event support related to game logic features. It also presents modules of code to represent, interpret, and adapt game features to provide the execution of configured games in multiple game platforms. As a proof of concept, a clone of the Doodle Jump game was developed using MEnDiGa assets and compared with original game version. As a result, a new G-factor based approach for game construction is provided, which is able to separate the core of game elements from the implementation itself in an independent, reusable, and large-scale way.

44	GameSE_abstract	Synchronizing Game and AI Design in PCG-Based Game Prototypes	Procedural content generation (PCG)-based game design aims to reach a new way of playing games by focusing gameplay around algorithmic game content generation. However, positioning interaction with PCG systems and generated content to the center of player experience poses design challenges for both game design and AI design. In order to create the wanted affordances, rich contextual information is required to make informed decisions on the generated content. While previous research has presented excellent developments on PCG's possibilities, further considering context and affordances in the early stages of prototyping may aid designers reach these possibilities in a more consistent manner. This study is set to discuss how context, affordances and the game's overall design can be considered during the prototyping process of PCG-based games. Misaligned game context and affordances can result in deeply rooted design issues that may later manifest as subpar gameplay experiences and increased development effort. These emergent issues are examined through a post-mortem case study to produce an extended PCG-based design process, featuring actionable steps, that takes context, affordances, and the game's overall design into account through meaningful play.

47	GameSE_abstract	Developing game-playing agents that adapt to user strategies: A case study	This paper describes the development of a novel web-delivered computer game, Boundary, where human players vie against each other or computer agents that use adaptive learning to modify playing strategies. The novelty presents challenges in game development both in terms of game playability and enjoyment as well as designing intelligent computer game players. An adaptive artificial intelligent agent was developed by creating several basic AI agents, each of which employs a unique, simple strategy. The adaptive agent classifies its opponent's play during the game by simulating what moves each simple strategy would make and identifying the strategy that produces the closest approximation to the opponent's actions. During development, through computer-computer simulations, the relative strengths of each strategy versus the others were determined. Thus, once an opponent's moves are matched to the closest known strategy, the best counter-strategy can be selected by the computer agent. Our hypotheses are that 1) humans will quickly learn how to counter the static AI strategies, 2) humans will have more difficulty learning how to counter the adaptive AI, and 3) human players will judge the adaptive player as more challenging. This paper describes human subject experiments to test those hypotheses.	Adaptive agents; AI in computer games; Learning; Play-testing	Brown, R.; Guinn, C.

48	GameSE_abstract	An evaluation of videogame network architecture performance and security	The recent introduction of higher reward in videogame competitions is expected to motivate unethical players to pursue opportunities to gain unfair advantages while playing networked videogames. Networked videogames implement a variety of approaches to attain a balance between reliable data transfer and game performance. Certain aspects of these network approaches may be exploited by players to gain unfair advantage or degrade the gaming experience for others. This paper lays the conceptual groundwork for networked videogames by describing common network architectures that facilitate competitive videogame play. These networking concepts are then evaluated for susceptibility to potential exploits. Finally, three current gaming titles are selected as case studies, using the principles established within this paper, to evaluate the effects of client-side exploits, latency, and state synchronization, on competitive game play.

49	GameSE_abstract	A state saturation attack against massively multiplayer online videogames	"Online videogames have enjoyed a recent surge in popularity due to increased work-from-home policies, the popularization of high-reward game tournaments, and the prospect of players earning decent wages from streaming online content. The viability of leveraging online gaming as a source of primary or supplemental income places higher stakes on the security and suitability of the network and underlying protocols used to transport game related data. A common technique used in videogames known as ""animation canceling"" has been used for decades to improve player performance in competitive game play. This paper reviews the potential impact of animation canceling in terms of network traffic generated and degradation to the player experience. The paper lays the conceptual groundwork for networked videogames by describing common network architectures that facilitates competitive videogame play. Finally, a AAA gaming title is selected as a case study, using the principles established within this paper, to evaluate the effects of animation canceling on competitive game play. This paper introduces a new term""state saturation"" to describe a potential lag-based attack that may be implemented via animation cancelling to starve client-server based networked videogame command messages and game a competetive edge during game play."

50	GameSE_abstract	Autonomous virtual player in a video game imitating human players: The ORION framework	This paper introduces the design of autonomous virtual player based on imitation learning using human behavior observations. The ORION model provides both data mining techniques allowing the extraction of knowledge and behavior models allowing the control of the autonomous behaviors. ORION is also an operational tool allowing the representation, transformation, visualization and prediction of data. We illustrate the use of our model by detailing the implementation of virtual player for the video game Unreal Tournament 3. Thanks to ORION, data from low level behaviors were collected through three scenarios performed by human players: movement, long range aiming and close combat. Behaviors can then be learned from the obtained data-sets after transformations and application of data mining techniques. ORION allows us to build a complete behavior using an extension of a Behavior Tree integrating ad hoc features in order to manage aspects of behavior that we have not been able to learn automatically.

In this context, mobile devices provide new resources when they join the environment, which disappear when they leave it. This introduces the challenge of self-adaptation, in which smart applications may either include new resources as they become available or replace them when they become unavailable. Ubiquitous games combine ubicomp and computer game technologies to enrich user's experience and fun. Such games may benefit from different input and output resources offered by mobile devices. To support the development and deployment of ubiquitous games, this work presents the uOS middleware. Using a DSOA (Device Service Oriented Architecture) based architecture and lightweight service discovery protocols, uOS ensures compatibility among resources, providing resource rerouting between heterogeneous and limited software and hardware platforms. The uMoleHunt game is presented to illustrate the practical application of uOS.	Games; Middleware; Ubigames; Ubiquitous computing	Buzeto, F.N.; Capretz, M.A.M.; Castanho, C.D.; Jacobi, R.P.

53	GameSE_abstract	Simulation based software development for smart phones	Smart phones are getting more and more popular each year and have more and better sensors. The sensors are a rich information source for creating contextaware applications. However, this makes the applications increase in complexity until they become too hard to test in the lab. In order to solve this problem, we propose to test this kind of applications through a simulator. The user interacts with the simulated environment using the keyboard and mouse like a computer game. But the application is not simulated and the user interacts with the application through a smart phone, giving a real experience.

54	GameSE_abstract	Game play in virtual reality driving simulation involving head-mounted display and comparison to desktop display	Previous studies have reported the effect of driving simulator games on simulator sickness and eye symptoms experienced by users; however, empirical results regarding the game experience using commercial virtual reality head-mounted displays (VR-HMDs) are lacking. We conducted an experiment where participants played a driving simulator game (Live for Speed) displayed through an Oculus Rift DK2 for up to 120 min. Game play duration was recorded. Game experience was surveyed using questionnaires about simulator sickness, eye symptoms, and game engagement. The results showed that the average game play duration for this specific driving simulation game was approximately 50 min. Simulator sickness was negatively correlated with affordable play duration using the VR-HMD. We also found that age was negatively correlated with game play duration. There were no differences between those who did and did not wear frame glasses. In addition, we compared the VR-HMD game play and traditional desktop LCD game play, in terms of simulator sickness, subjective eye symptoms, game engagement, and game performance. The results showed that VR-HMD game play in the driving simulation game was similar to the experience using the desktop LCD display, except for a moderately increased level of simulator sickness. These findings provide new data about VR-HMD's impact on game play and will inform game designers, players, and researchers for their choices and decisions on proper game duration and the type of devices.

55	GameSE_abstract	Radically Simplifying Game Engines: AI Emotions Game Self-Evolution	Today, video games are a multi-billion-dollar industry, continuously evolving through the incorporation of new technologies and innovative design. However, current video game software content creation requires extensive and often-times ambiguous planning phases for developing aesthetics, online capabilities, and gameplay mechanics. Design elements can vary significantly relative to the expertise of artists, designers, budget, and overall game engine/software features and capabilities. Game development processes are often extensively long coding sessions, usually involving a highly iterative creative process, where user requirements are rarely provided. Therefore, we propose significantly simplifying game design and development with novel Artificial Cognition Architecture real-time scalability and dynamic emotion core. Rather than utilizing more static emotion state weighting emotion engines (e.g. ExAI), we leverage significant ACA research in successful implementation of analog neural learning bots with Maslowan objective function algorithms. We also leverage AI- based Artificial Psychology software which utilizes ACA's fine grained self-evolving emotion modeling in humanistic avatar patients for Psychologist training. An ACA common cognitive core provides the gaming industry with wider applications across video game genres. A modular, scalable, and cognitive emotion game architecture implements Non-Playable Character (NPC) learning and self-evolution. ACA models NPC's with fine grained emotions, providing interactive dynamic personality traits for a more realistic game environment and enables NPC self-evolution under the influence of both other NPC's and players. Furthermore, we explore current video game design engine architecture (e.g. Unity, Unreal Engine) and propose an ACA integration approach. We apply artificial cognition and emotion intelligence modeling to engender video games with more distinct, realistic consumer gaming experiences, while simultaneously minimizing software gaming development efforts and costs.

56	GameSE_abstract	TrackGen: An interactive track generator for TORCS and Speed-Dreams	TrackGen is an online tool for the generation of tracks for two open-source 3D car racing games (TORCS and Speed Dreams). It integrates interactive evolution with procedural content generation and comprises two components: (i) a web frontend that maintains the database of all the evolved populations and manages the interaction with users (by collecting users evaluations and providing access to the evolved tracks) and (ii) an evolutionary/content-generation backend that runs both the evolutionary algorithm and generates the actual game content that is available through the web frontend. The first prototype of the tool was presented in July 2011 but advertised only to researchers; the first official version which generated tracks only for TORCS was released to the game community in September 2011; due to the many requests, we released a new version soon afterwards, in January 2012, with support for Speed Dreams (the fork of TORCS focused on visual realism and graphic quality) that has been online since then. From January 2012 until July 2014, TrackGen had more than 7600 unique visitors who visited the website around 11,500 times and viewed 85,500 pages; it was employed to evolve more than 8853 tracks, and it was used to download 12,218 tracks. Some of the tracks evolve by our system have been also included in the TORCS distribution.

57	GameSE_abstract	Model-driven approach of virtual interactive environments for enhanced user experience	The video game and entertainment industry has been growing in recent years, particularly those related to Virtual Reality (VR). Therefore, video game creators are looking for ways to offer and improve realism in their applications in order to improve user satisfaction. In this sense, it is of great importance to have strategies to evaluate and improve the gaming experience in a group of people, without considering the fact that users have different preferences and, coupled with this, also seeks to achieve satisfaction in each user. In this work, we present a model to improve the user experience in a personal way through reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike other approaches, the proposed model adjusts parameters of the virtual environment in real-time based on user preferences, rather than physiological data or performance. The model design is based on the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) approach and consists of three main phases: analysis phase, design phase, and implementation phase. As results, a simulation experiment is presented that shows the transitions between undesired satisfaction states to desired satisfaction states, considering an approach in a personal way.

58	GameSE_abstract	Multi-reality games: An experience across the entire reality-virtuality continuum	Interactive play can take very different forms, from playing with physical board games to fully digital video games. In recent years, new video game paradigms were introduced to connect real-world objects to virtual game characters. However, even these applications focus on a specific section of the Reality-Virtuality Continuum, where the visual embodiment of characters is either largely static toys in the real world or pre-animated within the virtual world according to a determined set of motions. We introduce a novel concept, called Multi-Reality Games, that encompasses interactions with real and virtual objects to span the entire spectrum of the Reality-Virtuality Continuum, from the real world to digital and/or back. Our application on real-virtual game interaction makes an evolutionary step toward the convergence of real and virtual game characters. Rather than static toys or prebuilt and unconfigurable virtual counterparts, we bring together technologies from the entire Reality-Virtuality Continuum to target new game experiences. We showcase our framework by proposing a game application on a mobile device. Without the need to change the location or set, we enable intuitive and seamless interactions between physical, augmented and virtual elements. The experience brings both worlds closer, and enables the user to customize the virtual scenario according to physical references.

59	GameSE_abstract	Intermediated reality	This thesis explores technical solutions to address the gap between the virtual and physical worlds towards photo-realistic interactive Augmented Reality (AR). As mobile network bandwidth increases, latencies reduce and graphics processing power becomes more efficient, this work tackles the challenge of convincingly re-animating physical objects remotely through digital displays. A framework for distributed Intermediated Reality (IR) communication is introduced, and forms the structure of the constituent methods developed for seamless collaboration through the remote possession of entities that come to life in mobile AR. To perform such augmentation in an unnoticeable way, a method of deforming surface camera samples for seamless animations of physical objects with background inpainting is first introduced. This technique, in combination with a method to retarget the proximate appearance of real shadows to deformed virtual shadows and a method to perform environment illumination estimation using inconspicuous flat Fresnel lenses, brings real-world props to life in a compelling and practical way. Each method is integrated together to perform in real-time with analysis and evaluations using metric comparisons to expected ground truth renderings are provided. Intermediated Reality can be applied to a variety of industries and scenarios beyond communication. This thesis presents applications in the movie industry and computer games sectors. For example, an approach to reduce the number of physical configurations needed for a stop-motion animation movie by generating the in-between frames digitally in AR is demonstrated. AR-generated frames preserve its natural appearance and achieve smooth transitions between real-world key-frames and digitally generated in-betweens. Further, the techniques extend across the entire Reality-Virtuality Continuum to target new game experiences called Multi-Reality games. This gaming experience makes an evolutionary step toward the convergence of real and virtual game characters for visceral digital experiences.

60	GameSE_abstract	An approach to validate crowd simulation software: A case study on crowdsim	Validation is an important topic on the life-cycle of software development, especially when we are working with crowd simulation. This is because when applied in safety fields, such simulation software must reproduce behaviors close to real life in order to obtain useful data. The International Maritime Organization of London (IMO) developed guidelines for validate evacuation systems. In this paper, these guidelines have been applied when using CrowdSim as a crowd simulation tool. It is important to mention that a set of validations must be reached by CrowdSim to consider it as an accurate crowd simulation software. In addition, we present the capabilities of CrowdSim when applied to provide crowd simulation on a middle school. The computed simulations are employed into an interactive game-based approach aiming to educate students and also develop a culture of safety.

61	GameSE_abstract	HTN or state space - Who should do planning in your game?	There is an ongoing discussion in the game AI community, whether to use AI planning for controlling nonplayer characters (NPCs) in computer games. Recent years have seen implementations of both state space and hierarchical task network (HTN) planning in AAA game titles, each having specific advantages and disadvantages. This paper is concerned with the performance aspect of both technologies and proposes a general methodology for comparing performance of action selection mechanisms. Two case studies comparing NPCs controlled by the JSHOP2 HTN planner and SGPlan 6 and Metric-FF state space planners in a gamelike competitive environment are presented and their results are statistically analyzed. First environment is a puzzle-like scenario with minor combat element and strong competition for limited resources. Second environment features two pairs of cooperating agents in a combat scenario inspired by the Gears of War series. It is concluded that in puzzle-like domains HTN planning is inferior to state space planning, but for the second domain, the results are not conclusive.

62	GameSE_abstract	Designing video games for the blind: results of an empirical study	Understanding non-functional software requirements and developing realizable operationalizations of them are critical to the success of any information system. Non-functional requirements dealing with accessibility and usability are especially important considerations when developing information systems for visually impaired stakeholders; however, this is not, yet, an area well understood in information systems development. This work aims to better understand the non-functional software requirements and realizable operationalizations needed to address the accessibility and usability challenges in computer gaming for the visually impaired. Building on previous work, this paper provides the analysis, results, and recommendations stemming from a systematic qualitative analysis of elicited qualitative text using adaptations of the grounded theory method. To do so, the authors developed a PC version of a 1980's, 2D, Arcade style video game incorporating joystick controls and sound effects and gathered user experience data from six visually impaired users through a closed, pre-game and post-game interviews. The contribution of this work is part of a larger effort to develop systematic requirements engineering approaches, utilizing qualitative methods, to elicit, analyze, and operationalize non-functional software requirements within the information systems development process, to provide equal access to information systems for visually impaired users.

63	GameSE_abstract	Emerson: Scripting for federated virtual worlds	We introduce Emerson, a scripting language for virtual worlds that are seamless, scalable, and federated. These worlds present a number of unique challenges. Most importantly, scripts that specify the behavior of the world are distributed across many hosts and users may generate and host scripts. These constraints imply features not common in other systems, such as frequent use of asynchronous message passing for basic interaction between entities, a lack of trust between entities inhabiting the world, and live-editing of entities in the world. Emerson addresses these challenges with three core design concepts: entity-based isolation and concurrency, an event driven model with concise and expressive pattern matching to find handlers for messages, and strong support for example-based programming within the live virtual environment. Our prototype implementation of Emerson, based on the V8 JavaScript engine, demonstrates that a variety of applications can be easily written in Emerson in a live system.

The CAP can either processthe received tasks from mobile users or offload them tothe cloud. In each round, we aim to jointly optimize theoffloading decisions of all users and the CAP, together withcommunication and processing resource allocation, to minimizethe overall cost of energy, computation, and the maximum delayamong all users. Since the centralized optimization problemis non-convex and mobile users may not follow the obtainedsolution, we further formulate a mobile cloud offloading game. We show the existence of a Nash equilibrium (NE) of thisgame and propose an algorithm to attain the NE.

65	GameSE_abstract	Context-Aware Mixed Reality: A Learning-Based Framework for Semantic-Level Interaction	Mixed reality (MR) is a powerful interactive technology for new types of user experience. We present a semantic-based interactive MR framework that is beyond current geometry-based approaches, offering a step change in generating high-level context-aware interactions. Our key insight is that by building semantic understanding in MR, we can develop a system that not only greatly enhances user experience through object-specific behaviours, but also it paves the way for solving complex interaction design challenges. In this paper, our proposed framework generates semantic properties of the real-world environment through a dense scene reconstruction and deep image understanding scheme. We demonstrate our approach by developing a material-aware prototype system for context-aware physical interactions between the real and virtual objects. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation results show that the framework delivers accurate and consistent semantic information in an interactive MR environment, providing effective real-time semantic-level interactions.	augmented reality; interaction; interaction techniques; methods and applications; methods and applications-computer games; virtual environments; * Computing methodologies - Scene understanding * Human-centred computing - Interaction design	Chen, L.; Tang, W.; John, N.W.; Wan, T.R.; Zhang, J.J.

66	GameSE_abstract	Automated video game world map synthesis by model-based techniques	World maps contribute a significant part of the interactivity and entertainment to modern video games. While large-scale industrial world map generation tools exist, their use usually implies a substantial learning curve, and the cost of licences restricts the accessibility of these tools to individual game developers. In this paper, we introduce a world map generator for Unity-based games that exploits model-based techniques. After the game-specific concepts of the world map are captured and turned into a metamodel, the world map generation problem is first formulated as a consistent graph generation problem solved by a state-of-the-art model generator.

67	GameSE_abstract	GLIB: Towards automated test oracle for graphically-rich applications	Graphically-rich applications such as games are ubiquitous with attractive visual effects of Graphical User Interface (GUI) that offers a bridge between software applications and end-users. However, various types of graphical glitches may arise from such GUI complexity and have become one of the main component of software compatibility issues. Our study on bug reports from game development teams in NetEase Inc. indicates that graphical glitches frequently occur during the GUI rendering and severely degrade the quality of graphically-rich applications such as video games. Existing automated testing techniques for such applications focus mainly on generating various GUI test sequences and check whether the test sequences can cause crashes. These techniques require constant human attention to captures non-crashing bugs such as bugs causing graphical glitches. In this paper, we present the first step in automating the test oracle for detecting non-crashing bugs in graphically-rich applications. Specifically, we propose GLIB based on a code-based data augmentation technique to detect game GUI glitches. We perform an evaluation of GLIB on 20 real-world game apps (with bug reports available) and the result shows that GLIB can achieve 100% precision and 99.5% recall in detecting non-crashing bugs such as game GUI glitches. Practical application of GLIB on another 14 real-world games (without bug reports) further demonstrates that GLIB can effectively uncover GUI glitches, with 48 of 53 bugs reported by GLIB having been confirmed and fixed so far.

68	GameSE_abstract	Automated design of architectural layouts using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm	The internal layouts of buildings in video games are usually designed by hand, but the increasingly expansive and realistic nature of virtual worlds introduces scalability issues which make manual design methods impractical. We present a new methodology that uses a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to automatically generate building layouts. The method accepts highly versatile input constraints, encoding layouts using a flexible binary tree representation and evaluating them on a range of criteria to ensure authentic results. Tests demonstrate that the method works well for a variety of problem instances representing an apartment, a family house, and an office floor; the ability to generate solutions for different types of buildings and to incorporate non-rectangular spaces shows greater versatility than many previous methods.

69	GameSE_abstract	Database caching for job-level computing	This paper improves upon Job-Level (JL) computing, a general distributed computing approach. In JL computing, a client maintains the overall search tree and parcels the overall search into coarse-grained jobs, which are then each calculated by pre-existing game-playing programs. In order to support large-scale problems such as solving 7x7 killall-Go, or building opening books for 9x9 Go or Connect6, JL computing is modified so that the entire search tree is stored in a database, as opposed to simply being stored in the client process' memory. However, the time cost of accessing this database becomes a bottleneck on performance when using a large number of computing resources. This paper proposes a cache mechanism for JL search trees. Instead of the previous approach, where the entire search tree is stored in the database, we maintain parts of the search tree in the memory of the client process to reduce the number of database accesses. Our method significantly improves the performance of job operations. Assuming that each job requires 30 seconds on average, the JL application with this cache mechanism can allow for the use of 5036 distributed computing resources in parallel without database accesses becoming the performance bottleneck.

70	GameSE_abstract	A game engine designed to simplify 2D video game development	In recent years, the increasing popularity of casual games for mobile and web has promoted the development of new editors to make video games easier to create. The development of these interactive applications is on its way to becoming democratized, so that anyone who is interested, without any advanced knowledge of programming, can create them for devices such as mobile phones or consoles. Nevertheless, most game development environments rely on the traditional way of programming and need advanced technical skills, even despite today's improvements. This paper presents a new 2D game engine that reduces the complexity of video game development processes. The game specification has been simplified, decreasing the complexity of the engine architecture and introducing a very easy-to-use editing environment for game creation. The engine presented here allows the behaviour of the game objects to be defined using a very small set of conditions and actions, without the need to use complex data structures. Some experiments have been designed in order to validate its ease of use and its capacity in the creation of a wide variety of games. To test it, users with little experience in programming have developed arcade games using the presented environment as a proof of its easiness with respect to other comparable software. Results obtained endorse the concept and the hypothesis of its easiness of use and demonstrate the engine potential.	2D video games; Game editor; Game Engine; Game logic	Chover, M.; Marin, C.; Rebollo, C.; Remolar, I.

71	GameSE_abstract	Improving software quality through design patterns: A case study of adaptive games and auto dynamic difficulty	Auto dynamic difficulty (ADD) is the technique of automatically changing the level of difficulty of a video game in real time to match player expertise. Recreating an ADD system on a game-by-game basis is both expensive and time consuming, ultimately limiting its usefulness. Thus, we leverage the benefits of software design patterns to construct an ADD framework. In this paper, we discuss a number of desirable software quality attributes that can be achieved through the usage of these design patterns, based on a case study of two video games.

72	GameSE_abstract	Coordinating dialogue systems and stories through behavior composition	We exploit behavior composition in AI as a formal tool to facilitate interactive storytelling in video games. This is motivated by (i) the familiarity of transition systems, on which behavior composition is based, in video game development, and (ii) the fact that behavior composition extends the spectrum of approaches for non-linear storylines by introducing a new paradigm based on planning for a target desired process instead of a goal state. Moreover, this approach provides support for the debugging of deadlocks in stories at design level. We describe the behavior composition framework, and show the details for an interactive dialogue system scenario in order to illustrate how interactive storytelling can be phrased in terms of it. We also report on a simple architecture for implementing a demo game over the scenario using existing behavior composition tools.

73	GameSE_abstract	Adaptable aging factory for multiple objects and colorations	The visual effects of synthetic objects and environments from modern video games and movies require an impressive amount of detail to properly duplicate their real world equivalents. Among these details, effects produced by aging are particularly hard to handle, and adding them is significantly time-consuming. Existing methods such as physically based and empirical simulations are not suitable for artists since they require the manipulation of complex physical parameters, and their results are difficult to control. Our approach offers a framework for quickly adding aging effects based on a simple example. By defining an aging recipe based on local properties, an artist can easily apply similar effects to different objects or to multiple occurrences of the same object. Also, when aging patterns consist of simple color variations, we propose a color-independent process capable of producing various colorations of the same effect from a single example.

74	GameSE_abstract	A Minimal Training Strategy to Play Flappy Bird Indefinitely with NEAT	A large number of algorithms to generate behaviors of game agents have been developed in recent years. Most of them are based on artificial intelligence techniques that need a training stage. In this context, this paper proposes a minimal training strategy to develop autonomous virtual players using the NEAT neuroevolutionary algorithm to evolve an agent capable of playing the Flappy Bird game. NEAT was used to find the simplest neural network architecture that can perfectly play the game. The modeling of the scenarios and the fitness function were set to ensure adequate representation of the problem compared to the real game. The fitness function is a weighted average based on multiple scenarios and scenario-specific components. Coupling the minimal training strategy, a representative fitness and NEAT, the algorithm had a short convergence time (around 20 generations), with a low complexity network and achieved the perfect behavior in the game.	artificial intelligence; autonomous agents; flappy bird; neuroevolution	Cordeiro, M.G.; Serafim, P.B.S.; Nogueira, Y.L.B.; Vidal, C.A.; Cavalcante Neto, J.B.

76	GameSE_abstract	The domain of parametric hypercubes for static analysis of computer games software	Computer Games Software deeply relies on physics simulations, which are particularly demanding to analyze because they manipulate a large amount of interleaving floating point variables. Therefore, this application domain is an interesting workbench to stress the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency of abstract domains for static analysis. In this paper, we introduce Parametric Hypercubes, a novel disjunctive non-relational abstract domain. Its main features are: (i) it combines the low computational cost of operations on (selected) multidimensional intervals with the accuracy provided by lifting to a power-set disjunctive domain, (ii) the compact representation of its elements allows to limit the space complexity of the analysis, and (iii) the parametric nature of the domain provides a way to tune the accuracy/efficiency of the analysis by just setting the widths of the hypercubes sides. The first experimental results on a representative Computer Games case study outline both the efficiency and the precision of the proposal.

77	GameSE_abstract	Kahawai: High-quality mobile gaming using GPU offload	This paper presents Kahawai, a system that provides high-quality gaming on mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones, by offloading a portion of the GPU computation to server-side infrastructure. In contrast with previous thin-client approaches that require a server-side GPU to render the entire content, Kahawai uses collaborative rendering to combine the output of a mobile GPU and a server-side GPU into the displayed output. Compared to a thin client, collaborative rendering requires significantly less network bandwidth between the mobile device and the server to achieve the same visual quality and, unlike a thin client, collaborative rendering supports disconnected operation, allowing a user to play offline - albeit with reduced visual quality. Kahawai implements two separate techniques for collaborative rendering: (1) a mobile device can render each frame with reduced detail while a server sends a stream of per-frame differences to transform each frame into a high detail version, or (2) a mobile device can render a subset of the frames while a server provides the missing frames. Both techniques are compatible with the hardwareaccelerated H.264 video decoders found on most modern mobile devices. We implemented a Kahawai prototype and integrated it with the idTech 4 open-source game engine, an advanced engine used by many commercial games. In our evaluation, we show that Kahawai can deliver gameplay at an acceptable frame rate, and achieve high visual quality using as little as one-sixth of the bandwidth of the conventional thin-client approach. Furthermore, a 50- person user study with our prototype shows that Kahawai can deliver the same gaming experience as a thin client under excellent network conditions.

80	GameSE_abstract	Evolving Controllers for Mario AI Using Grammar-based Genetic Programming	Video games mimic real-world situations and they can be used as a benchmark to evaluate computational methods in solving different types of problems. Also, machine learning methods are used nowadays to improve the quality of non-player characters in order (i) to create human like behaviors, and (ii) to increase the hardness of the games. Genetic Programming (GP) has presented good results when evolving programs in general. One of the main advantage of GP is the availability of the source-code of its solutions, helping researchers to understand the decision-making process. Also, a formal grammar can be used in order to facilitate the generation of programs in more complex languages (such as Java, C, and Python). Here, we propose the use of Grammar-based Genetic Programming (GGP) to evolve controllers for Mario AI, a popular platform to test video game controllers which simulates the Nintendo's Super Mario Bros. Also, as GP provides the source-code of the solutions, we present and analyze the best program obtained. Finally, GGP is compared to other techniques from the literature and the results show that GGP find good controllers, specially with respect to the scores obtained on higher difficulty levels.	game controller; grammar-based genetic programming; mario ai	De Freitas, J.M.; De Souza, F.R.; Bernardino, H.S.	2018 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, CEC 2018 - Proceedings	https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2018.8477698				Excluded	Excluded	new_screen		AI: Studies that were focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI).	2	Scopus	2018	Evolving Controllers For Mario Ai Using Grammar-Based Genetic Programming	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056252389&doi=10.1109%2fCEC.2018.8477698&partnerID=40&md5=a87918708aaf2bc34fef8fab16191f6f	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc	nan; Venue; References; Pages; Year; Bibtex
81	GameSE_abstract	An automatic tool to facilitate authoring animation blending in game engines	Achieving realistic virtual humans is crucial in virtual reality applications and video games. Nowadays there are software and game development tools, that are of great help to generate and simulate characters. They offer easy to use GUIs to create characters by dragging and drooping features, and making small modifications. Similarly, there are tools to create animation graphs and setting blending parameters among others. Unfortunately, even though these tools are relatively user friendly, achieving natural animation transitions is not straight forward and thus non-expert users tend to spend a large amount of time to generate animations that are not completely free of artefacts. In this paper we present a method to automatically generate animation blend spaces in Unreal engine, which offers two advantages: the first one is that it provides a tool to evaluate the quality of an animation set, and the second one is that the resulting graph does not depend on user skills and it is thus not prone to user errors.

The main idea consists of representing the scenarios existing at a quest level by a particular type of Petri net called WorkFlow net. A kind of qualitative analysis based on the proof trees of linear logic can then be performed in order to prove the correctness of the soundness property which corresponds to a consistent quest from the point of view of the game. An extended version of theWorkFlow nets which allows the inclusion of discrete resources permits representing in a formal way, the different items that the player can find and use during the quests of the game.

Even though they have been used by commercial games since the 1980s, it was only in recent years that this kind of approach has been given the righteous attention in the academic context. In this work, we propose a procedural content generation approach for creating infinite environments for a 2D platform runner game. The approach consists of a Genetic Algorithm that innovatively takes into account environment aesthetics as well as game's physics and rules in its fitness function. Therefore, the created environments should be pleasant and possible to be overcome by the player. An instantiation of the approach was developed using the Godot Game Engine. Time viability for in-game real-time generation and convergence to high/stable fitness values were experimentally evaluated. Our tests indicated parameter ranges that performed best in terms of environment quality and processing time were mutation rates between 0.5% and 1% aligned with a population ranging from 50 to 100 individuals. This approach is expandable to other games that have a tilemap-based environments.

84	GameSE_abstract	Interactive machine learning for more expressive game interactions	Videogame systems incorporate varied sensors to increase the range of player interactions and improve player experience. However, implementing robust recognisers for player actions with sensors presents significant challenges to developers. Further, sensor-based controls offer little player customisation compared to traditional input interfaces (gamepads, keyboards and joysticks). Past research on motion-driven music systems has successfully used interactive machine learning (IML) techniques to facilitate the development and customisation of sensor-based interfaces, both by developers and end users. However, existing standalone software tools for IML are not ideal for use in game development and distribution. In order to support more effective and flexible use of sensors by game developers and players, we developed an integrated IML solution for Unity3D in the form of a visual node system supporting classification, regression and time series analysis of sensor data.

85	GameSE_abstract	Building game scripting DSL's with the Metacasanova metacompiler	Many video games rely on a Domain Specific Language (DSL) to implement particular features such as artificial intelligence or time and synchronization primitives. Building a compiler for a DSL is a time-consuming task, and adding new features to a DSL is hard due to the low flexibility of the implementation choice. In this paper, we introduce an alternative to hand-made implementations of compilers for DSLs for game development: the Metacasanova metacompiler. We show the advantages of this metacomplier in terms of simplicity of designing and coding requirements, and in terms of performance of the resulting code, whose efficiency is comparable with hand-made implementations in commercial general purpose languages.

86	GameSE_abstract	High performance encapsulation and networking in Casanova 2	Encapsulation is a programming technique that helps developers keeping code readable and maintainable. However, encapsulation in modern object-oriented languages often causes significant runtime overhead. Developers must choose between clean encapsulated code or fast code. In the application domain of computer games, speed of execution is of utmost importance, which means that the choice between clean and fast usually is decided in favor of the latter. In this paper we discuss how encapsulation is embedded in the Casanova 2 game development language, and show how Casanova 2 allows developers to write encapsulated game code, which thanks to extensive optimization achieves at the same time high levels of performance. Furthermore, we show that the abstractions provided by Casanova so far cover no more than the tip of the iceberg: we document a further extension in the traditionally challenging domain of networking and show how the language can provide significant improvement in productivity.

88	GameSE_abstract	A computer model for simulating the bicycle rider's behavior in a virtual riding system	People are increasingly demanding to experience realistic behavior of virtual characters in computer games. In this article, we build a computer model for simulating a bicycle rider's behavior in a virtual riding system. A method to calculate the speed of a bicycle rider is proposed to improve the reality in a virtual riding system. In this method, the property of physical energy is introduced, and the bicycle-riding speed is calculated in real time according to the relationship between the rider's physical energy and bicycle-riding speed. Then based on the analysis of the behavior of a cyclist in a real competition, various behaviors of the virtual rider are designed and a behavior-tree for the virtual bicycle rider is constructed accordingly. On the basis of these, a virtual riding system is developed. The experiments results show that our system can simulate the behavior of a virtual bicycle rider, and thus encourage exercise on a stationary bicycle.

89	GameSE_abstract	Evaluating the Benefits of Model-Driven Development: Empirical Evaluation Paper	Researchers have been evaluating the benefits of Model-Driven Development (MDD) for more than a decade now. Although some works suggest that MDD decreases development time, other works limit MDD benefits to academic exercises and to developers without experience. To clarify the benefits of MDD, we present the results of our experiment, which compares MDD and Code-centric Development (CcD) in terms of correctness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Our experiment achieves fidelity to real-world settings because the tasks are taken from real-world video game development, and the subjects use domain frameworks as they are used in real-world developments. Our results challenge previous ideas that limit the benefits of MDD to academic exercises and to developers without experience. Furthermore, our results also suggest that understanding the benefits of MDD might require researchers to rethink their experiments to include the social part of software development.

90	GameSE_abstract	Comparing UML-Based and DSL-Based Modeling from Subjective and Objective Perspectives	In the last two decades, researchers have conducted several empirical evaluations, involving thousands of subjects, to understand the use of models in software development. The results of these evaluations show that most of the subjects make informal use of the models, which is known as 'modeling as sketch'. In this paper, we present an experiment that compares UML-based and DSL-based modeling when subjects model a part of a commercial video game. In the comparison, we have used objective and subjective measures, in contrast to other works that focus either on objective measures to evaluate modeling performance or on subjective measures to analyze modeling styles. Our results reveal that subjects underestimate the potential of their own models. Our finding is relevant for the design of future evaluations and for the teaching and adoption of modeling. If users correctly assess their models, they might leverage their potential as programs.	DSL; Empirical comparison; Modeling languages; UML	Domingo, A.; Echeverria, J.; Pastor, O.; Cetina, C.

91	GameSE_abstract	A simple method for real-time metal shell simulation	Realistic animation and rendering of the metal shell is an important aspect for movies, video games and other simulators. Usually this is handled by FEM method, which requires extremely high computational cost due to solving the stiffness matrix. We now propose a trick that could smartly avoid the large scale computation required by FEM, and could still generate visually convincing images of metal shell. We do so by first partitioning the shell into k rigid sub-shells that evolve independently during impact, before using a simple spring-mass model is applied between each adjacent vertex to retain continuity of the shell. This technique could produce realistically looking deformed rigid shells in real-time and can easily be integrated in any game engine and physics engine.

92	GameSE_abstract	GCI: A Transfer Learning Approach for Detecting Cheats of Computer Game	Cheating in massive multiple online games (MMOGs) adversely affect the game's popularity and reputation among its users. Therefore, game developers invest large amount of efforts to detect and prevent cheats that provide an unfair advantage to cheaters over other naive users during game play. Particularly, MMOG clients share data with the server during game play. Game developers leverage this data to detect cheating. However, detecting cheats is challenging mainly due to the limited client-side information, along with unknown and complex cheating techniques. In this paper, we aim to leverage machine learning based models to predict cheats over encrypted game traffic during game play. Concretely, network game traffic during game play from each player can be used to determine whether a cheat is employed. A major challenge in developing such a prediction model is the availability of sufficient training data, which is sparingly available in practice. Game traffic obtained from a few known players can be easily labeled. However, if such players are not a good representation of the population (i.e., other players), then a supervised model trained on labeled game traffic from these set of players may not generalize well for the population. Here, we propose a scalable transfer learning approach to overcome the constraints of limited labeled data. Our empirical evaluation on a popular MMOG demonstrates significant improvement in cheat prediction compared to other competing methods.

93	GameSE_abstract	Toward high-level reuse of statechart-based AI in computer games	Designing an interesting AI for a computer game is a complex undertaking, providing motivation to reuse portions of successful AIs. Here we advocate a layered Statechart-based AI as a modular approach that simplifies reuse. We analyze Statechart interactions and communications with respect to AI design, and propose an interface for Statechart-based AI modules that summarizes interactions. Reuse is accomplished by adding and removing modules to a new AI, largely enabled through event-renaming to ensure coherence with the interfaces. We describe an approach to module composition using functional groups, which allow for the encapsulation of high level behaviours (e.g., fleeing or exploring). This enables a designer to compose new AIs by assigning high-level behaviours. Additionally, the interface describes interactions with the game at-large, leading naturally to portability between games and even implementation languages. Finally, we look ahead to the requirements for a tool that would implement these ideas.	ai; computer games; reuse; statecharts	Dragert, C.; Kienzle, J.; Verbrugge, C.

94	GameSE_abstract	Reusable components for artificial intelligence in computer games	While component reuse is a common concept in software engineering, it does not yet have a strong foothold in Computer Game development, in particular the development of computer-controlled game characters. In this work, we take a modular Statechart-based game AI modelling approach and develop a reuse strategy to enable fast development of new AIs. This is aided through the creation of a standardized interface for Statechart modules in a layered architecture. Reuse is enabled at a high-level through functional groups that encapsulate behaviour. These concepts are solidified with the development of the SkyAI tool. SkyAI enables a developer to build and work with a library of modular components to develop new AIs by composing modules, and then output the resulting product to an existing game. Efficacy is demonstrated by reusing AI components from a tank to quickly make a much different AI for a simple animal.

Then edge regeneration strategy is used to seamlessly stitches the edges of multiple unit terrains. Unlike the existing works, edge regeneration strategy regenerates the connection area between multiple unit terrains, to expand the terrain size and shape while the existing terrain unchanged.

96	GameSE_abstract	Automatic Emotional Balancing in Game Design: Use of Emotional Response to Increase Player Immersion	This research aims to propose a theoretical model for the automatic balancing of games using the emotional state of the players. When launching a new game on the market, companies want to reach the largest number of people who are interested in playing the released title and for that they spend a large volume of resources to balance the games and deliver a good experience to the players. But this is not always possible because there are several types of players and each one has an expectation regarding the game. Some like a more difficult game, others prefer to just enjoy the narrative, but this, if defined statistically, limits the player to having multiple experiences, because the person may prefer to focus on the narrative and at the same time enjoy some moments with more action that, in a static configuration would be blocked. Given these assumptions, if the game can identify in real-time players' emotions, it may be able to make changes to the game design, manipulating the narrative and elements of the gameplay. One way to increase the player's involvement could be done through the monitoring of physiological signals and using AI algorithms to classify emotional states that potentiate changes in the scenarios and narrative of the story. In this study an approach based on biofeedback is explored, the measured physiological signals are used to make inferences about the emotional state of the player and this information is used to inform the game.

This artificial neural network pattern uses three input layer network patterns, four hidden layers, one output layer. The data obtained are cultural and hand index data. Pointable and hand are part of finger tracks issued by the Leap Motion sensor. The type of movement used to move 3D objects in this research is a swipe to wave, circle to go, Keytap to walk, Screencap to advance or run. The data needed in the design of backpropagation artificial neural applications is to take variables from the data obtained from Pointables and hands to the coordinates of the x, y, and z-axes. The resulting accuracy result is 96.7%.

98	GameSE_abstract	PEARS: Physics Extension and Representation Through Semantics	Today's physics engines mainly simulate classical mechanics and rigid body dynamics, with some late advances also capable of simulating massive particle systems and some approximations of fluid dynamics. An accurate numerical simulation of complex nonmechanical processes in real time is beyond the state of the art in the respective fields. This paper illustrates an alternative approach to a purely numerical solution. It uses a semantic representation of physical properties and processes as well as a reasoning engine to model cause and effect between objects, based on their material properties. Classical collision detection is combined with semantic rules to model various physical processes, for example, in the areas of thermodynamics, electrodynamics, and fluid dynamics as well as chemical processes. Each process is broken down into fine-grained subprocesses capable of approximating continuous transitions with discretized state changes. Our system applies these high-level state descriptions to low-level value changes, which are directly mapped to a graphical representation of the scene. We demonstrate our framework's ability to support multiple complex, causally connected physical and chemical processes by simulating a Goldberg machine. Our performance benchmarks validate its scalability and potential application for entertainment or edutainment purposes.

Past game development environments range from programs running monolithically on standalone computers to synthetic environments that support distributed modules (programs) running concurrently on different computers. This paper discusses one such environment, the construction synthetic environment (COSYE) based on high level architecture (HLA), which has potential as a game development environment. Then a framework for developing project management games within COSYE is proposed, based on experiences from previous game developments. Examples of games discussed include the bidding game, a tunnelling game and a crane lift planning game. This framework is meant to simplify game development.

100	GameSE_abstract	A systematic capture and replay strategy for testing complex GUI based java applications	In this paper we propose a testing strategy that targets Java applications with complex GUI structure and event interactions. We present a capture and replay testing technique which can be employed for different testing purposes: GUI convergence, functional testing and regression testing. The proposed strategy drastically improves, and from different aspects, on standard capture and replay tools. This is done by combining both a model based testing approach with the capture and replay approach and by implementing different automated test oracles. We first model the behavior of the system from the functional specifications or from a trusted version of the system. Tests are then derived from this model to exercise the system in order to ensure correct functional behavior and to cover goal oriented interactions. The case study applies the test strategy on a role-based, multi-user computer game to demonstrate the usefulness and importance of this approach.

101	GameSE_abstract	Using text-to-speech to prototype game dialog	Voice acting is common in computer games in many genres. The recording and processing of voice acting is a time-consuming process that involves, for instance, voice actors, directors, audio engineers, and game writers. Changes to the script of a game after the voice acting has been recorded are expensive. At the same time, playtests of games without voice acting may give different results than testing where it is present. This creates a situation where improvements identified from play testing are either ignored or leads to extensive re-recording of voice acting. This article presents a design science research project where text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis is used as a substitute for recorded voice acting in the early stages of game production. We propose a set of design principles that have been evaluated in a sharp game production. Our results indicate several benefits of using TTS as a prototyping tool: It can be a source of inspiration for game writers, it gives good estimations on timing and pacing of the game, and it allows for early tests of how the dialog will be perceived by players. The quality and characteristics of the voices provided by the TTS system play an important role in this process. The rapid development in the speech technology field opens many future possibilities.

102	GameSE_abstract	Game development from a software and creative product perspective: A quantitative literature review approach	This article presents the methodology and initial analysis of a systematic literature review that aims to explore how the craft and processes of game development have been studied in previous research. In particular, the review focuses on how previous research treats the inherent duality of video game development, since it both involves computer software development and creative production. Researchers are often in a position where they need to emphasize game development's relation to one of these disciplines, and it is not unusual for game development to be treated as a direct offspring of one field with some mild influences from another. Employing a more all-encompassing review approach, that includes research conducted from the perspectives of both computer science and the arts and humanities equally, makes the presented study different from previous literature reviews. The results show that there is a tendency that the management of software development has a negative correlation with the management of creativity in the studied material. The heterogenity of the fields and the limited amount of studies that focus on the duality of game development suggest that there is a need for a deeper analysis of the individual components and to synthesize results from disparate fields.

103	GameSE_abstract	'I have a different kind of brain'--a script-centric approach to interactive narratives in games	In a computer game narrative, a user influences the ordering of events. To model this behaviour, game designers and writers need to use some kind of programming primitives. A computer game script will hence differ from, for instance, a movie screenplay in that traditional dialogue text is complemented with some textual or visual logic formalism. Not all groups involved in production of a game have a programming background and may therefore be unable to easily comprehend such formalisms. This paper presents a novel approach to game dialogue writing where traces from play-throughs are used as the core of the script. Alternative branches are identified and presented in relation to the main trace. The approach has been implemented in a tool that has been used successfully by three professional writers in mobile game production. The results indicate that this is a promising approach to enable non-programmers to work with interactive narratives.

104	GameSE_abstract	A Case Study of Generative Adversarial Networks for Procedural Synthesis of Original Textures in Video Games	Procedural content generation is helping game developers to create significant quantity of high quality dynamic content for video games at a fraction of cost of the traditional methods. Procedural texture synthesis is a sub category of procedural content generation which helps video games to have significant variations in textures of the environments and the objects across the progress of the game and to avoid repetition. Generative Adversarial Networks are a class of deep learning algorithms which are capable of learning the patterns and creating new patterns. In this paper, Generative Adversarial Networks is used for procedural content generation for original textures synthesis for video game development. This method is used by video game designers for autonomous redesigning of objects and environment textures. This process saves significant time and cost in video game development. The particular attention in this paper is on procedural synthesis of ground surface textures. The generated texture samples are visually acceptable and have mean score of 2.45 with 0.1 standard deviation after 2K iteration. Also the discriminator loss of generated samples reached 0.74 at the final stage of training. The proposed framework can be used as an effective procedural texture synthesis framework for video game design and development.	deep convolutional networks; Generative adversarial network; procedural content generation; texture synthesis; video games	Fadaeddini, A.; Majidi, B.; Eshghi, M.	2018 2nd National and 1st International Digital Games Research Conference: Trends, Technologies, and Applications, DGRC 2018	https://doi.org/10.1109/DGRC.2018.8712070		118-122		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen		Content Creation: Studies that were focused on Content Creation.	2	Scopus	2018	A Case Study Of Generative Adversarial Networks For Procedural Synthesis Of Original Textures In Video Games	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066503789&doi=10.1109%2fDGRC.2018.8712070&partnerID=40&md5=2fa4862b78aa6282e752eacfcae4febd	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc	nan; Venue; References; Year; Bibtex
105	GameSE_abstract	The study of real-time animation of forest scene in wind projection	Real-time animation of forest has become an integral part of many graphic applications like virtual reality and computer games. In this paper, we present a novel real-time method to simulate forest in wind which maintains physical reality at the same time. In this method, the wind projection is calculated based on the rules of forest meteorology which will take the position of trees in forest into consideration and compute the influence of trees to wind. Instead of physical equation, experience formula in meteorology is employed to accelerate computing process. Users can simulate different kinds of trees by changing coefficients in formulas which can be calculated based on the features of branches and leaves. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective with highly realism and practical for interactive applications.	Animation; Forest meteorology; Wind projection	Fan, J.; Xiao, S.

106	GameSE_abstract	Game team balancing by using particle swarm optimization	Game balancing affects the gaming experience of players in video-games. In this paper, we propose a novel system, team ability balancing system (TABS), which is developed for automatically evaluating the performance of two teams in a role-playing video game. TABS can be used for assisting game designers to improve team balance. In TABS, artificial neural network (ANN) controllers learn to play the game in an unsupervised manner and they are evolved by using particle swarm optimization. The ANN controllers control characters of the two teams to fight with each other. An evaluation method is proposed to evaluate the performance of the two teams. Based on the evaluation results, the game designers can adjust the abilities of the characters so as to achieve team balance. We demonstrate TABS for our in-house MagePowerCraft game in which each team consists of up to three characters.

108	GameSE_abstract	Integrating usability evaluation into model-driven video game development	The increasing complexity of video game development highlights the need of design and evaluation methods for enhancing quality and reducing time and cost. In this context, Model-Driven Development approaches seem to be very promising since a video game can be obtained by transforming platform-independent models into platform-specific models that can be in turn transformed into code. Although this approach is started to being used for video game development, there is a need for usability evaluation methods specifically tailored to this type of development process. In this paper, we present a usability inspection method that can be used along all the stages of the model-driven video game development. The method relies on a Usability Model that is aligned with the ISO/IEC 25010 (SQuaRE) standard and decomposes usability into measurable attributes and metrics specific for the video game domain.

109	GameSE_abstract	A model-based approach for designing location-based games	Location-Based Games (LBGs) are a subclass of pervasive games that make use of location technologies to consider the players' geographic position in the game rules and mechanics. This research presents a model to describe and represent LBGs. The proposed model decouples location, mechanics, and game content from their implementation. We aim at allowing LBGs to be edited quickly and deployed on many platforms. The core model component is LEGaL, a language derived from NCL (Nested Context Language) to model and represented the game structure and its multimedia contents (e.g., video, audio, 3D objects, etc.). It allows the modelling of mission-based games by supporting spatial and temporal relationships between game elements and multimedia documents. We validated our approach by implementing a LEGaL interpreter, which was coupled to an LBG authoring tool and a Game Server. These tools enabled us to reimplement a real LBG using the proposed model to attest its utility. We also edited the original game by using an external tool to showcase how simple is to transpose an LBG using the concepts introduced in this work. Results indicate both the model and LEGaL can be used to foster the design of LBGs.

110	GameSE_abstract	Proposing interaction patterns for designing videogames supported in Smartphones	Finding common solutions to recurring design problems or creating computer programs is one way to improve communication between designers of software products and multiple users. Nowadays, one of the practices used to find these solutions is through patterns, which have their origin in architecture and have been used since the 90s in the software world. Still, it is not easy to decide which of the existing patterns are more appropriate for use in videogames design, so that it can contribute to the ease of use of videogames. For this reason, this paper presents a proposal to obtain a set of interaction patterns focused on ease of use, which are related to the design of videogames supported in Smartphones. This, from gathering information about interaction patterns of traditional software and entertainment software.

111	GameSE_abstract	Software techniques for multimodal input processing in realtime interactive systems	Multimodal interaction frameworks are an efficient means of utilizing many existing processing and fusion techniques in a wide variety of application areas, even by non-experts. However, the application of these frameworks to highly interactive application areas like VR, AR, MR, and computer games in a reusable, modifiable, and modular manner is not straightforward. It currently lacks some software technical solutions that (1) preserve the general decoupling principle of platforms and at the same time (2) provide the required close temporal as well as semantic coupling of involved software modules and multimodal processing steps. This thesis approches current challenges and aims at providing the research community with a framework that fosters repeatability of scientific achievements and the ability to built on previous results.

112	GameSE_abstract	Semantics-based software techniques for maintainable multimodal input processing in real-Time interactive systems	Maintainability, i.e. reusability, modifiability, and modularity, is a critical non-functional quality requirement, especially for software frameworks. Its fulfilment is already challenging for lowinteractive application areas. It is additionally complicated by complex system designs of Real-Time Interactive Systems (RISs), required for Augmented, Mixed, and Virtual Reality, as well as computer games. If such systems incorporate AI methods, as required for the implementation of multimodal interfaces or smart environments, it is even further exacerbated. Existing approaches strive to establish software technical solutions to support the close temporal and semantic coupling required for multimodal processing and at the same time preserve a general decoupling principle between involved software modules. We present two key solutions that target the semantic coupling issue: (1) a semantics-based access scheme to principal elements of the application state and (2) the specification of effects by means of semantic function descriptions for multimodal processing. Both concepts are modeled in an OWL ontology. The applicability of our concepts is showcased by a prototypical implementation and explained by an interaction example that is applied for two application areas.

113	GameSE_abstract	Semantic Entity-Component State Management Techniques to Enhance Software Quality for Multimodal VR-Systems	Modularity, modifiability, reusability, and API usability are important software qualities that determine the maintainability of software architectures. Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR, AR, MR) systems, modern computer games, as well as interactive human-robot systems often include various dedicated input-, output-, and processing subsystems. These subsystems collectively maintain a real-time simulation of a coherent application state. The resulting interdependencies between individual state representations, mutual state access, overall synchronization, and flow of control implies a conceptual close coupling whereas software quality asks for a decoupling to develop maintainable solutions. This article presents five semantics-based software techniques that address this contradiction: Semantic grounding, code from semantics, grounded actions, semantic queries, and decoupling by semantics. These techniques are applied to extend the well-established entity-component-system (ECS) pattern to overcome some of this pattern's deficits with respect to the implied state access. A walk-through of central implementation aspects of a multimodal (speech and gesture) VR-interface is used to highlight the techniques' benefits. This use-case is chosen as a prototypical example of complex architectures with multiple interacting subsystems found in many VR, AR and MR architectures. Finally, implementation hints are given, lessons learned regarding maintainability pointed-out, and performance implications discussed.	multimodal processing; Real-time interactive systems; software architecture; virtual reality systems	Fischbach, M.; Wiebusch, D.; Latoschik, M.E.

114	GameSE_abstract	Exploring Indie Game Development: Team Practices and Social Experiences in A Creativity-Centric Technology Community	The emergence of various interest-based online communities has led to the popularity of new forms of distributed creative teamwork such as citizen science, crowdsourcing, and open source software development. These new phenomena further complicate the context and content of distributed creative teamwork: what are the characteristics of these new forms of creative teams? And how do they shape people's perceptions and social experiences of distributed creative teams? In this paper, we report our empirical research of the team characteristics and practices in a creativity-centric technology community (i.e., independent [indie] game development) in hopes of exploring these questions. Our findings show that 1) indie game development teams are formed upon shared aspirations and use various strategies to collaborate with friends or online strangers; and their team practices are achieved through a balance between individual creativity and collective vision as well as a collaborative learning for problem solving and self-improvement; and 2) these teams mediate new forms of social interaction and collaborative experiences, featuring a mix of online comradery and weak social ties, and a mix of self-confidence and self-confliction. Using this new dataset and research context, we confirm and extend existing theories of distributed creative teams in CSCW. We also argue that studying these small-scale, self-selected, and interest-based teams can inform the design of collaborative systems to support various creative teams' social needs.

116	GameSE_abstract	Streamlining domain analysis for digital games product lines	Digital games and their development process are quite peculiar when compared to other software in general. However, current domain engineering processes do not addresses such peculiarities and, not surprisingly, successful cases of software product lines (SPLs) for digital games cannot be found in the literature nor the industry. With such a motivation, this paper focuses on streamlining and enriching the Domain Analysis process for SPLs targeted at digital games. Guidelines are provided for making Domain Analysis tasks aware of digital games peculiarities, in order to tackle the challenges of and benefit from the unique characteristics of such a macro-domain. A case study for an SPL aimed at arcade-based games is also presented to illustrate and evaluate the proposed guidelines.

117	GameSE_abstract	An improved progressive mesh and streaming transmission strategy	The transmission of large scale Web 3D scene is one of the most valuable problems for the researchers in computer graphics. As the increase of the size of Web 3D scene data and its complicity organizations, the limited bandwidth of current network can hardly meet the requirement in transmissions of these data, so it become a bottleneck in Virtual Reality, Video Games, Digital Museum, ect. This paper introduces an improved algorithm which is proposed to get better performance of progressive mesh and streaming transmission data. By using this method we can generate smaller size of base model and the respective streaming information. In addition, we decimate some of data by using Huffman encoding to get the final binary file, as while, the data was encrypted.

118	GameSE_abstract	A Comparative Usability Analysis of Handheld Game Consoles	A handheld game console is a small and portable video game console with a built-in screen, game controls and speakers. Playing a handheld game console involves multiple operations and buttons. The usability of game consoles is influenced by users' expertise and skills. In this study, we mainly focused on testing the usability of products instead of video games and we adopted three variables from Leventhal and Barnes' usability model (reference) to analyze two game consoles (Switch and 3DS-LL) on three variables: task match, the ease of learning, and the ease of use. We recruited novice users and compared the usability of the two-handle mode and single-handle mode of Switch, and of Switch and 3DS-LL. Finally, we raised some suggestions for the design of handheld game consoles regarding usability.	Consoles; Handheld game console; Usability	Gao, W.; Wang, Y.; Zhang, W.; Qin, C.; Soares, M.M.

119	GameSE_abstract	Development of software architecture for a 3d virtual environment with the incorporation of a reactive intelligent agent	The development of applications with Virtual Reality technology is currently on the rise. However, there is no formal methodology or architecture for the creation of this type of systems. However, to solve the problem, traditional information systems methodologies, traditional information systems methodologies are used that have been adapted to the development of this type of applications, which has caused a waste of the resources that these technologies offer. That is why we propose the design of architecture specifically for a 3D Virtual Environment, using an artificial intelligence technique, in this case, an Intelligent Reactive Agent. The proposed architecture was developed from a Videogame architecture.	3D virtual environment; Intelligent agent; Systems architecture	Garcia, T.J.L.; Rodriguez-Aguilar, R.M.; Alvarez-Cedillo, J.A.; Alvarez-Sanchez, T.

120	GameSE_abstract	A framework for tailorable games: toward inclusive end-user development of inclusive games	One strategy toward universalizing play is enabling more people to develop their own games. In this paper, our efforts toward a framework for inclusive creation of inclusive games are discussed. The hypothesis is that if end-users used creation tools suitable to their interaction needs and followed a collaborative work model to iteratively improve accessibility features to be inserted into a software architecture able to modify human-computer interaction at use-time, then they would be able to create games satisfying heterogeneous interaction needs of possible players. To verify the hypothesis, the architecture, the collaborative work model, and a game creation platform (Lepi) were designed to support game creation and play activities. Abilities were focused to provide opportunities for contributions based on skills, interests, and knowledge of people. The framework was evaluated over ten meetings spanning four months by people with alcohol and drug addiction from a public healthcare service. With the framework, participants were able to create their own games despite their different interaction needs (including low literacy, no previous contact with computers, emotional disabilities). By following the collaborative work model, they enabled people with different interaction needs than their own to play their games. Hence, with the framework, opportunities were provided to enable people with different interaction needs to contribute, create, and play. Game creation became a jigsaw puzzle, on which each piece (contribution) allowed people to create and play according to their abilities and skills.

121	GameSE_abstract	Autonomous virtual vehicles with FNN-GA and Q-learning in a video game environment	Driving autonomous virtual vehicles have been developed by the use of several artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. However, it is possible to improve their results and find other applications through the use of new algorithms or combinations of them. Taking into account this, in this work, firstly Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) were selected, and then, these algorithms were combined to have the new FNN-GA algorithm. In order to evaluate its performance, the most popular circuits, such as ovals and tracks with different types of curves, were selected from auto racing, which were implemented in the Unity 2D video game engine. After, as a way to compare the performance of the FNN-GA algorithm, the Q-learning algorithm was selected, and the agents to learn with them were placed on said tracks. As a result, after executing 100 generations of the agents, per algorithm, it is found that taking into account the better use of CPU and RAM resources, Q-learning is the best, on the contrary, taking into account the quantity of in learning generations, FNN-GA is the best since it learns in fewer generations. On the other hand, both algorithms learn easier on ovals than on circuits with different types of curves.

122	GameSE_abstract	GAMESPECT: Aspect Oriented Programming for a Video Game Engine using Meta-languages	Video game programming is an area where code duplication is extremely prevalent. Similar types of tasks are performed in multiple places throughout a game engine codebase. For example: game balance, logging, and memory allocation are just a few of the areas which are located across disparate locations of the codebase. Meanwhile, aspect oriented programming (AOP) was created to make use of common themes in a codebase and allow for advice to be given during compilation or runtime. GAMESPECT is a Domain Specific language (DSL) which resides in a higher level language space, above the typical languages used by game engines such as Unreal Engine 4. The language is written with the popular XText language toolset and contains advices in the spirit of aspect oriented programming: point cuts and join points. These advices can be executed at runtime when the programmer wants to finetune values or perform debugging. The advising is made possible through the Clang toolchain. Unique to this approach, GAMESPECT takes a source language and converts into multiple target languages. Depending on the context, GAMESPECT can generate C++, LUA, Blueprints or Skookum Script. This type of source to source translation is made possible through GAMESPECT's 'composition specifications'. With GAMESPECT, video game designers can increase their productivity and reduce the required lines of code for certain tasks by a 9-40% reduction. In addition, it provides for an AOP platform which is agnostic to the underlying game code. The applicability of this approach extends beyond game programming into software engineering as a whole.	aspect oriented; DSL; metalanguage; multilanguage; scripting language; UE4; video game engine	Geisler, B.J.; Mitropoulos, F.J.; Kavage, S.

123	GameSE_abstract	A Multi-engine Aspect-Oriented Language with Modeling Integration for Video Game Design	"Video game programming is a diverse, multi-faceted endeavor involving elements of graphics programming, systems programming, UI, HCI, and other software engineering disciplines. Game programmers typically employ a new ""codebase"" per software artifact which often means a unique choice of game engines and scripting languages. Non-portable code is exacerbated by a lack of a shared language and a lack of translation utilities between languages. Meanwhile, many game programming tasks occur time and time again. Aspect-oriented programming was largely developed to assist software engineers in decoupling tasks while maintaining software reuse. GAMESPECT is a language that promotes software reuse through aspects while also providing a platform for translation of software artifacts which has enabled it to be used in multiple game engines across multiple projects. Code reuse on these projects has been high and our methodologies can be summarized by discussing three tenants of GAMESPECT: 1) composition specifications, which define source to source transition properties 2) pluggable aspect interpreters and 3) high level language constructs and modeling language constructs (MDAML) which encourage designer friendly terminology. By comparing accuracy, efficiency, pluggability, and modularity, these three tenants are demonstrated to be effective in creating a new game programming language."

124	GameSE_abstract	A Hybrid Approach to Procedural Generation of Roguelike Video Game Levels	Algorithmic generation of data, known as procedural content generation, is an attractive prospect within the game development industry as a means of creating infinitely fresh and varied content. In this paper, we present an approach to level generation for roguelike dungeon style levels, based on our examination of the suite of existing approaches used in formal research. Our generator aims to create simple dungeon style level layouts that are always playable. We utilise a hybrid technique combining context free grammars to generate a description of levels and a cellular automata inspired process to generate the physical space. The generator proves successful at consistently generating dungeon layouts that maintain completability at all times with sufficient variation, when accounting for the occasional need for corrective actions. We conclude that there is substantial value in hybrid approaches to automated level design and propose a new heuristic by which to assess dungeon style level content.	context free grammars; dungeons; game design; PCG; procedural content generation; roguelike	Gellel, A.; Sweetser, P.

125	GameSE_abstract	A novel privacy technique for Augmented Reality cloud gaming based on image authentication	The evolution of cloud gaming systems is substantially the security requirements for computer games. Although online game development often utilizes artificial intelligence and human computer interaction, game developers and providers often do not pay much attention to security techniques. In cloud gaming, location-based games are augmented reality games which take the original principals of the game and applies them to the real world. In other terms, it uses the real world to impact the game experience. Because the execution of such games is distributed in cloud computing, users cannot be certain where their input and output data are managed. This introduces the possibility to input incorrect data in the exchange between the gamer's terminal and the gaming platform. In this context, we propose a new gaming concept for augmented reality and location-based games in order to solve the aforementioned cheating scenario problem. The merit of our approach is to establish an accurate and verifiable proof that the gamer reached the goal or found the target. The major novelty in our method is that it allows the gamer to submit an authenticated proof related to the game result without altering the privacy of positioning data.

126	GameSE_abstract	MC-GAN: A Reimplementation of GameGAN with a Gaming Perspective	Creating games is a costly process involving tons of vigorous efforts, time, and resources. Different game engines were introduced to facilitate the game-making process, such as Unreal Engine, Unity, and Godot. However, despite the advent of game engines, the vacuum of automatically creating new games by computers was still felt. With artificial intelligence (AI) development and its growing presence in the industry, game developers made a new game development branch using AI. One of the essential steps in this context was the introduction of GameGAN, which inspired us for this article. Here we propose Multi-Class GamgeGan(MC-GAN), a starting point for the next generation of game engines based on GameGAN. In addition, MC-GAN is capable of classifying each desired game element and even changing its class to change the element's nature (e.g., MC-GAN can change static elements to dynamic ones). Moreover, MC-GAN uses only one complex model trained once per game. Once it is trained for that specific game, there will be no need for training to produce a new level of that game, a considerable step in the developing industry. Considering that MC-GAN is only the beginning of this big journey; therefore, it is now the best choice for developing web games since they are compact and straightforward. This article first briefly introduces GamGAN and its features; afterward, we get through MC-GAN features and compare them to other similar works.

127	GameSE_abstract	An incremental method for extracting tests from object-oriented specification	Context The nature of the object-oriented development process is iterative and incremental, and through this process, software artifacts are refined and evolved continuously; however, most of proposed methods for deriving test cases from formal, object-oriented specifications have been adapted from previous structural techniques and are not aligned with such an incremental process. These methods are not adaptive with changes in the software specification, and there is no mechanism to evolve test artifacts respectively. Moreover, the existing methods do not cover all different object-oriented testing levels, i.e., intra-method, inter-method, intra-class and inter-class levels. Objective This paper presents an incremental method for extracting tests from formal, object-oriented specifications. Extracted tests are adaptive with changes in the class specification. In addition, the proposed method covers all different object-oriented testing levels. Method We first make a test machine (as a new notion introduced in this paper) for each class operation to cover the intra-method test level. With the combination of these test machines, new test machines covering the inter-method and intra-class test levels can be made. Extracted tests can be easily modified when the class specification is modified, and, in this way, our approach enables iterative and incremental test derivation. With test machines corresponding to a class hierarchy, this approach can also be used for deriving inter-class tests. Results As a case study, we applied our method to the specification of a computer game. Results indicate that test machines can incrementally be extracted through a class hierarchy, and a parent test machine can be used to obtain its corresponding child test machines (by reusing test artifacts). Furthermore, by running extracted test cases on the implemented game, we discovered some real bugs. Conclusion The proposed approach can incrementally extract tests and bring extendibility and reusability as two main advantages of the object- oriented paradigm to the test domain.

128	GameSE_abstract	AI4U: A tool for game reinforcement learning experiments	Reinforcement Learning is a promising approach to the design of Non-Player Characters (NPCs). It is challenging, however, to design games enabled to support reinforcement learning because, in addition to specifying the environment and the agent that controls the character, there is the challenge of modeling a significant reward function for the expected behavior from a virtual character. To alleviate the challenges of this problem, we have developed a tool that allows one to specify, in an integrated way, the environment, the agent, and the reward functions. The tool provides a visual and declarative specification of the environment, providing a graphic language consistent with game events. Besides, it supports the specification of non-Markovian reward functions and is integrated with a game development platform that makes it possible to specify complex and interesting environments. An environment modeled with this tool supports the implementation of most current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft Actor-Critic algorithms. The objective of the developed tool is to facilitate the experimentation of learning in games, taking advantage of the existing ecosystem around modern game development platforms. Applications developed with the support of this tool show the potential for specifying game environments to experiment with reinforcement learning algorithms.

129	GameSE_abstract	Enriching evaluation in video games	One of the greatest challenges to the evaluation of UX in video games is to ascertain if the experience is appropriate for the game. Thus, it is necessary to know how to measure Playability in order to analyze, optimize and adapt it to the player's preferences. However, it is also important to remember that the final satisfaction of the user depends on his or her emotional response, social and cultural influences and hedonic properties of the interaction process with a video game. In this paper we present a way to perform a UX evaluation based on Playability by adding hedonic factors. The aim is to easily and cost-effectively analyze the UX in an agile video game development process.

130	GameSE_abstract	Development of Tactical Level AI for Melee and Range Combat	The development of AI directly affects the emergence of new technologies. In modern video games, AI faces a wide range of tasks at various levels. The current situation is such that in addition to standard decision-making, to which the average player is casual, AI often has to do more complex things: to perceive the environment, interact with it, interact with the other AI, move in a complex three-dimensional space and other various tasks. Given the constant development of the gaming industry, the requirements for AI are constantly increasing. Therefore, there is the problem of AI flexibility. In video games, we can increasingly see how the battle of two NPCs turns into a simple search of teams to attack and defend. These primitives repel the player, destroying a decent part of the gameplay conceived by the developer. In the same way it is applicable to the visualization of historical events. For accurate reconstruction, it is necessary that the behavior of the agents be similar to human's behavior. In this paper, we give a brief review on some of well-known AI development methods, compare their effectiveness and present a new method of AI development that simulate the behavior of non- player character in melee and ranged combat based on the interaction of three levels: strategic, tactical and operational for decision-making. Combination of the well-known methods of AI development, base agent's model change and improvement in agent understanding of the environment by using the Voronoi diagram. The method proposed in this paper are showing significantly different results from the most popular design methods and the Utility-AI-Behavior Tree method, significantly reducing the distance in terms of key indicators such as survive time, use of useful resources, number of enemies killed. The used method imitates the player's actions, while excluding the human error factor and unexpected actions. The designed AI simulates the player's logical actions with a good accuracy, but is still more predictable than the real players. Mathematical calculations and the distribution of weights on each frame do not have a significant impact on performance, which allows simulating the behavior of many agents at once in one scenario, without losing performance and influencing the resulting sensations from the gameplay.

131	GameSE_abstract	Building a Game Engine: A Tale of Modern Model-Driven Engineering	Game engines enable developers to reuse assets from previously developed games, thus easing the software-engineering challenges around the video-game development experience and making the implementation of games less expensive, less technologically brittle, and more efficient. However, the construction of game engines is challenging in itself, it involves the specification of well defined architectures and typical game play behaviors, flexible enough to enable game designers to implement their vision, while, at the same time, simplifying the implementation through asset and code reuse.

132	GameSE_abstract	The gameplay loop: A player activity model for game design and analysis	To describe the task of the game designer, the literature on the subject often refers to rules and systems. But the main objective of the game designer's work is to create a specific kind of experience: gameplay. Based in both literature and diverse modes of practical experience, this article offers a formal delineation and methodology of the gameplay loop that is applicable for both design and analysis. This approach considers this loop as the potentials states of the player in the game system. This article will report use of this model in the development of recent industry games as well as in the analysis of existing titles for academic purposes.

135	GameSE_abstract	A taxonomy of video games and AI	Game developers have always striven to create better and more complex games. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in games is increasing in game development to this end. However there appears to be a mismatch of implications and expectations between game developers and AI researchers of what AI can bring to games, mostly due to differences of interpretation of the problems involved. To overcome this we present a taxonomy to aid knowledge transfer between the two groups, including elements from environments, game theory, and information theory.We also identify other concepts of games and AI that could be important to both sides.

136	GameSE_abstract	PerGO: An ontology towards model driven pervasive game development	Model Driven Software Development (MDSD) & Domain Specific Modeling (DSM) are means to overcome software development challenges like increased software complexity and shortened development cycle in many domains. However, in the computer game domain it is not widely and successfully applied yet since it is not easy to understand the complex domain knowledge and use the knowledge to develop qualified DSM solutions. These difficulties can be alleviated by a deep and thorough domain analysis. In our research, we proposed an ontology to structure and accelerate the domain analysis process. To make our work more concrete, we focus on the emerging pervasive (computer) game genre.	Domain analysis; DSM; MDSD; Ontology; Pervasive game	Guo, H.; Traetteberg, H.; Wang, A.I.; Gao, S.

137	GameSE_abstract	Realcoins: A case study of enhanced model driven development for pervasive games	Model Driven Development (MDD) and Domain Specific Modeling (DSM) have been widely used in information system domains and achieved success in many open or in-house scenarios. But its application in the game domain is seldom and immature. In our research, we identified three issues that should be considered carefully in order to play the strength of MDD in the game development environment to a larger extend: 1) structured domain analysis should be done to assure the size and familiarity of the domain; 2) adapted process should be designed to save cost and support evolution; and 3) proper tools (especially language workbenches) should be evaluated and utilized to ease DSM tasks and accelerate iterations. In this paper, we explain these three issues and illustrate our solutions to them by presenting the development details (both technical and procedural) of one pervasive game case. We evaluate the gains and costs by involving MDD into the game development process. We reflect on the issues we have met, and discuss possible future works as well.

138	GameSE_abstract	An evaluation of ontology based domain analysis for model driven development	Although Domain Analysis (DA) is important for Model Driven Development (MDD), traditional DA methods are demanding and not practical in many situations. When computer games are developed, game design (problem domain) is usually decided in a gradual way within iterations where software prototypes are constructed and playtest are performed. In such a case, it is not practical to fit a heavyweight DA in the highly iterative process. Researchers indicated that vocabularies were expected to automate game design. Such vocabularies can be reused in another form in DA tasks. In this research, the authors developed an ontology and a DA procedure based on it. To evaluate them, theoretical analysis, case studies, and a user acceptance survey were used. The results indicated that the ontology met the general requirement as a domain vocabulary, and it enhanced the DA process in an expected way. Most of external potential users (46 in total) considered the ontology useful and easy to use.

139	GameSE_abstract	Lessons from practicing an adapted model driven approach in game development	Various authoring tools have been used to ease the game creation. However, these pre-defined tools may not be suitable for some emerging or special domains. We proposed an approach named Game Creation with Customized Tools (GCCT) to create tools for certain domains first, and then create games using these tools. GCCT is based on the widely applied Model Driven Development (MDD) approach. Despite the apparent appropriateness and benefits, MDD also has drawbacks. Among them, non-trivial cost for tools development is prominent. To address this, some enhancements were made in GCCT, and two case studies were performed to evaluate the cost and the productivity when involving GCCT. In this paper, we reported the results of the case studies as well as practical lessons we have learnt.

But MDD also has drawbacks and as a result, persons often have concerns to adopt MDD. To alleviate this, some enhancements were made in GCCT and a user survey was performed to probe the user attitude towards this enhanced MDD approach. 46 persons responded to the survey and the result indicated that in general, GCCT was useful and easy to use. The participants intended to use GCCT primarily because they thought that GCCT was useful. Users' familiarity with computer games and MDD did not have a strong impact on users' understanding and adoption of GCCT.

141	GameSE_abstract	A Workflow for Model Driven Game Development	Software development faces challenges from high expectation of software qualities, complexity of software and long development cycle. While Domain Specific Modeling (DSM) is helping developers overcome many of these challenges in many domains, it is not generally applied in the computer game domain. DSM can be hard to apply in the computer game domain because of the complexity of computer game domain knowledge and the peculiarity of traditional computer game development process. Without fully understanding these issues and properly solving them, the strength of DSM approaches will be constrained and game developers will be reluctant to use DSM. In this article, we investigate the development process and explore the feasibility of fitting DSM tasks in traditional computer game development in a compact way to lower cost and improve software quality. We introduce the workflow and illustrate the usage of it by presenting a case study. Further, we discuss the benefits and costs of involving DSM solutions in computer game development. Finally, we present the limitations and future work.

142	GameSE_abstract	Ontology-based domain analysis for model driven pervasive game development	Domain Analysis (DA) plays an important role in Model Driven Development (MDD) and Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM). However, most formal DA methods are heavy weight and not practical sometimes. For instance, when computer games are developed, the problem domain (game design) is decided gradually within numerous iterations. It is not practical to fit a heavy-weight DA in such an agile process. In this research, we propose a light-weight DA which can be embedded in the original game development process. The DA process is based on a game ontology which serves for both game design and domain analysis. In this paper, we introduce the ontology and demonstrate how to use it in the domain analysis process. We discuss the quality and evaluate the ontology with a user acceptance survey. The test result shows that most potential users considered the ontology useful and easy to use.

143	GameSE_abstract	Dynamic difficulty adjustment of game AI by MCTS for the game Pac-Man	Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) of Game AI aims at creating a satisfactory game experience by dynamically adjusting intelligence of game opponents. It can provide a level of challenge that is tailored to the player's personal ability. The Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm can be applied to generate intelligence of non-player characters (NPCs) in video games. And the performance of the NPCs controlled by MCTS can be adjusted by modulating the simulation time of MCTS. Hence the approach of DDA based on MCTS is proposed based on the application of MCTS. In this paper, the prey and predator game genre of Pac-Man is used as a test-bed, the process of creating DDA based on MCTS is demonstrated and the feasibility of this approach is validated. Furthermore, to increase the computational efficiency, an alternative approach of creating DDA based on knowledge from MCTS is also proposed and discussed.

144	GameSE_abstract	Automatic Verification for Node-Based Visual Script Notation Using Model Checking	Visual script languages with a node-based interface have commonly been used in the video game industry. We examined the bug database obtained in the development of FINAL FANTASY XV (FFXV), and noticed that several types of bugs were caused by simple mis-descriptions of visual scripts and could therefore be mechanically detected. We propose a method for the automatic verification of visual scripts in order to improve productivity of video game development. Our method can automatically detect those bugs by using symbolic model checking. We show a translation algorithm which can automatically convert a visual script to an input model for NuSMV that is an implementation of symbolic model checking. For a preliminary evaluation, we applied our method to visual scripts used in the production for FFXV. The evaluation results demonstrate that our method can detect bugs of scripts and works well in a reasonable time.

145	GameSE_abstract	A DSL for describing the artificial intelligence in real-time video games	Many games have computer-controlled agents that play against a player. The behavior of these computer-controlled agents is described by means of the artificial intelligence (AI) in the game. The AI is an important component of the game, and needs to be developed carefully, and adapted regularly. This paper introduces a novel language for describing the decision making process of the AI in real-time video games. We develop a declarative, domain-specific language (DSL) embedded in the functional programming language Haskell for real-time video games. We use the DSL to describe the AI of a prototype real-time video game.

146	GameSE_abstract	Layered artificial intelligence framework for autonomous agents	In computer games, the current trend is to create large virtual worlds with numerous non-player characters. Usually their artificial intelligence is implemented by scripting, which can be a burden for application developers. This paper suggests an approach, in which hard-coded scripting is replaced by autonomous agents with personal characteristics. Using this approach the amount of scripting needed is reduced and the resulting agents can be made to behave in natural manner. Also, applying e.g. the goal-oriented agent paradigm is easy. The definitions needed are written using a script language; therefore the agent configurations can be tested rapidly. We have also implemented a specific tool for simplifying the actual code-writing task. For evaluating our approach, we have extended an existing environment and created a framework. We present two example scenarios specialized from it.

147	GameSE_abstract	A graph editor for remote composition of game music for small-scale game development	Similar to a movie's soundtrack, the music score of a computer game must provide an immersive and captivating experience to the user. Hence, the score needs to adapt and react to the gameplay in real time. Many software tools have been developed to support music composition for interactive computer applications such as games. The most advanced of these tools rely on graphbased representations of a composition using MIDI scores. The graph is formed from nodes, which represent MIDI files, and transitions between them, which are governed by conditions. This describes the music to be synthesized depending on the state of the game and the history of states. Some of these tools even come with an integrated API (Application Programming Interface) and a ready-touse game sound engine to facilitate game soundtrack production. However, none of these tools focuses on the long tail market of low-end games for mobile devices or browser-based games, especially those written in Adobe Flash. Such a technically limited environment requires more specific tools, such as the one we demonstrate here.

148	GameSE_abstract	An approach to automated videogame beta testing	Videogames developed in the 1970s and 1980s were modest programs created in a couple of months by a single person, who played the roles of designer, artist and programmer. Since then, videogames have evolved to become a multi-million dollar industry. Today, AAA game development involves hundreds of people working together over several years. Management and engineering requirements have changed at the same pace.

149	GameSE_abstract	Using an extended technology acceptance model for online strategic video games: a case of Multiplayer online Battle Arena	Due to the rising popularity of online strategic video games, it is crucial to examine the acceptance structure of these games. This study attempts to perform an acceptance evaluation of online strategic video games, particularly multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), using an extended technology acceptance model (TAM) developed in the current literature and establish a predictive value in determining the behavioral intention in playing online strategic video games. To carry out this objective, a case study consisting of 439 undergraduate students as a sample was conducted. After the data filtering process which involves the removal of insincere responses and non-engaging responses and of those who have not played MOBA games, 278 research participants became the final sample. The questionnaire was created and underwent reliability analysis. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was computed to show the relatedness of each factor as well as to determine its validity and internal reliability. Nine factors were considered in this work that tested for significant relationships and predictive capabilities using structural equation modeling with AMOS software. These factors include altruism, social interaction, use context, perceived ease of enjoyment, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude, flow, and behavior intention. Results show that the significant determinants of user behavior intention are the flow, attitude, and perceived ease of use while the perceived enjoyment, social interaction significantly influence attitudes in playing online strategic video games, use context, and flow. Furthermore, this work also demonstrates that altruism, social interaction, use context, perceived enjoyment, flow, and attitude are significant factors that can be added to extend TAM. These findings would serve as guidelines in the formulation of principles for game design and development.

151	GameSE_abstract	Component-based hierarchical state machine A reusable and flexible game AI technology	Finite State Machine (FSM) is the most common used technique to create intelligent character behaviors in video games. But conventional FSM technique has many limitations in game development. The main innovation of this paper is the introduction of software component technology to the implementation of FSMs in game development, which modularizes the states and transitions of FSMs completely. Compared with the conventional FSMs, this technique has three advantages. First, high-level and complex intelligent behaviors can be constructed from a set of low-level and simple behavior rapidly. Second, high-level game designing can be decoupled from low-level game AI programming. Third, game characters equipped with this AI system can exhibit more flexibility and adaptability to the changing game environment.	artificial intelligence; based hierarchical state machine; finite state machine; game AI; software reuse; video game	Hu, W.; Zhang, Q.; Mao, Y.

152	GameSE_abstract	Verifying adaptation of neuro-controlled game opponent by cross validation under supervised and unsupervised player modeling	As a new trend of game development, Artificial Intelligence (AI) used to be implemented by Finite State Machine (FSM) is being replaced by domain-knowledge-free automatic game design approaches. These training methods could achieve excellent performance as FSM and contribute to other improvements: Non Player Character's (NPC) behaviors appear wide differences based on player action, and for multiple opponents in a single game, they can learn to cooperate and form anti-strategy, which could greatly augment entertainment of game. In this paper, by using Pac-man of prey and predator game genre as test-bed and Upper Confidence bound for Trees (UCT) algorithm to generate training data for Artificial Neural Network (ANN), we demonstrate adaptation is confirmable with cross validation result under supervised and unsupervised player modeling. As a conclusion, we will clarify how theory developed in this paper could contribute to practical application in online video game and exert excellent game performance.

153	GameSE_abstract	Efficient Imitation Learning for Game AI	Automation testing is an important approach for bug detection and analysis of software applications, especially for computer games. This paper proposes an efficient imitation method to learn game strategy from a small set of manually recorded game samples, which only takes one hour to complete training. This work can be divided into four steps. Firstly, we collect a set of manually recorded data composed of image frames and user actions. The discriminative region is extracted from image to eliminate noise. Then, data alignment is applied to solve the problem of action delay. Due to the large variation of image samples from different classes, data resampling is performed to avoid bias. Finally, these samples are fed into a fast and lightweight network with LSTM structure, which is designed to boost speed of prediction. Our work discards the dependence of game internal interface and performs well in real time with CPU, which has been verified in a variety of commercial games.	class balance; fast and lightweight network; game AI; imitation learning	Huang, C.; Zhang, L.; Jing, Y.; Zhou, D.

154	GameSE_abstract	Intelligent Pathfinding Algorithm in Web Games	"In recent years, with the hardware development of the web game is getting better and better, the game graphics computing ratio decreased a lot, the traditional scene and picture effect obtained great development at the same time, players began to pay attention to the content of a video game, hope the game role behavior can more close to real people, which makes the game developers in the artificial intelligence to enhance investment in the game, and in game ai, the role of intelligent pathfinding system is always the key point of the research. Intelligent pathfinding algorithm plays A leading role in intelligent pathfinding system. At present, the most classic intelligent pathfinding algorithm used in video games is A* (A-Star) algorithm. Many other excellent pathfinding algorithms are also developed from this algorithm. The purpose of this paper is to get rid of the limitation of having to use standard A* algorithm functions to guide pathfinding so as to quickly find A shortest path in the map. In this paper, through A detailed study of the standard A* algorithm, several optimization methods are proposed to improve it. Firstly, heuristic coefficients are added to the heuristic function of A* algorithm to optimize the search for redundant paths in pathfinding process. Binary heap is used to maintain the open list in A* algorithm. Then, the path weight in the map is optimized. The generated path is smoothed by ""take the median insertion method"", and the A* algorithm is further optimized by the zonal search method, so that it can be applied to A wider range of game map types. Finally, through the test of a simulation experiment program produced by Unity3D engine, the above methods are verified. The results of this paper show that after improving the standard intelligent pathfinding algorithm, pathfinding efficiency is higher, the range of use is wider, the player experience is better, and it can be applied in the game."

155	GameSE_abstract	Efficient simplification methods for generating high quality LODs of 3D meshes	Two simplification algorithms are proposed for automatic decimation of polygonal models, and for generating their LODs. Each algorithm orders vertices according to their priority values and then removes them iteratively. For setting the priority value of each vertex, exploiting normal field of its one-ring neighborhood, we introduce a new measure of geometric fidelity that reflects well the local geometric features of the vertex. After a vertex is selected, using other measures of geometric distortion that are based on normal field deviation and distance measure, it is decided which of the edges incident on the vertex is to be collapsed for removing it. The collapsed edge is substituted with a new vertex whose position is found by minimizing the local quadric error measure. A comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms reveals that the proposed algorithms are simple to implement, are computationally more efficient, generate LODs with better quality, and preserve salient features even after drastic simplification. The methods are useful for applications such as 3D computer games, virtual reality, where focus is on fast running time, reduced memory overhead, and high quality LODs.

156	GameSE_abstract	A study on an efficient spatialisation technique for near-field sound in video games	This article presents a simple and efficient method for spatialising sound in virtual environments by adding low pass filters (LPF) to the already widespread panning and attenuation techniques. Through two different experiments, variations in subject performance when locating sounds in a virtual environment between regular 3D audio from popular game engines (Unreal Engine and Unity) and our proposed sound system were evaluated. The first experiment consists of an audio-only test via an online survey, whereas the second experiment employs a minimalistic 3D video game which allows for user interaction guided by sound. Results of both experiments suggest better performance and accuracy when using LPFs, the second one finding a significant difference when comparing both techniques. We conclude that the LPF technique, as a mean for spatialisation of sounds coming from behind the subject, could be applied to complement current audio systems due to their performance-oriented nature and their good results with real users.	3D audio; Acoustics; Directional sound; Entertainment technology; Spatial attention	Ibanez, M.L.; Alvarez, N.; Peinado, F.

In Unreal Engine 4 Blueprints, game logic is described as node-graph style visual scripts. In the proposed method, inputs and outputs of nodes are modeled as variables in the model. The behaviors of the inputs and outputs are represented as transitions of the variables.

158	GameSE_abstract	Monte-Carlo Tree Search Implementation of Fighting Game AIs Having Personas	In this paper, we propose a method for implementing a game AI with a persona using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Video games are now a powerful entertainment media not just for players but spectators as well. Since each spectator has personal preferences, customized spectator-specific gameplay is arguably a promising option to increase the entertainment value of video games streaming. In this paper, we focus on personas, which represent playstyles in the game, in particular fighting games. In order to create an AI player (character) with a given persona, we use a recently developed variant of MCTS called Puppet-Master MCTS, which controls all characters in the game, and introduce a new evaluation function, which makes each character take their actions according to the given persona, and roulette selection-based simulation to this MCTS. The results of a conducted experiment using FightingICE, a fighting game platform used in a game AI competition at CIG since 2014, show that the proposed method can make both characters successfully behave according to given personas, which were identified by participants - spectators - in the experiment.

160	GameSE_abstract	Efficient virtual plant data structure for visualization and animation	Virtual plants are interesting but costly objects in video games and virtual reality applications. Despite advances on Level of Detail approaches and increasing GPU power, previous work fails in producing convincing and generic vegetation with low bandewidth requirements for web display. The efficiency drops down considering costs of compression and inner structure redundancy is still poorly explored. We propose here a tree graph as a generic output of simulation, easy to implement from any rule based plant generator. This graph allows to efficiently compress similar structures, that appear naturally as a result of procedural definition. Nodes carry minimal attributes, mainly related to age. Upon display requests, nodes orientation and precise geometry are computed using a simple graph exploring approach based on a very small number of parameters,. This exploration allows to generate all past growth stages and dynamic effects such as pruning. We show how this graph can be efficiently generated from L-systems, as well as from a functional-structural plant simulator. We illustrate that, thanks to this encoding and reconstruction scheme, a simple tree simulation can generate a wide range of geometrical plant exports at various ages, and is compatible with classical level of detail rendering approaches for geometric models.

162	GameSE_abstract	Prolog-Scripted Tactics Negotiation and Coordinated Team Actions for Counter-Strike Game Bots	k-labs is a research project exploring the possibilities of the logic programming paradigm in bot behavior programming for first-person shooter (FPS) games. The focus of previous work was to make Prolog a usable tool for bot programming and a baseline for further extensions. This paper presents one such extension, which makes it possible to script tactics of the entire team of bots. The algorithm was tested by bot-to-bot computer tests and by running surveys among human players who volunteered to take part in the research. The results of the both tests are presented in this paper. The extension itself demonstrates the flexibility of the framework. Although the proposed method for defining team behaviors relies solely on the knowledge of the bot's designer, alternative approaches, which use rules that are obtained by computational techniques, can also be developed. Such approaches are also being investigated as part of the k-labs project.

163	GameSE_abstract	Player profiling and quality assessment of dynamic car racing tracks using entertainment quantifier technique	"Interactive games have been an interesting area of research and have many challenges. With the advancement in technology, games have been revolutionizing at each step per the emerging and variant interests of players. Recently, machine learning techniques are used for the generation of game content based on player's experience. The dynamic content generation in computer games based on player's experience and feedback is still a challenging task. This requires measurement of entertainment factor achieved by a player during a game. In order to measure entertainment factor, we need to incorporate human-computer interaction by evolution of game content with respect to player's response. Optimization techniques can be used for the measurement of entertainment factor and for the generation of dynamic game content. The use of computational intelligence techniques in game development can lead to a new domain called ""computational intelligence in games."" This research is focused on car racing game genre, and the paradigm selected for dynamicity is track generation of car racing game. It requires player profiling and classification of players. The optimization of track generation has been performed by using single and multiobjective genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization. Initially, classification of player's rank based on data and theory-driven approaches has been performed. Moreover, 3 different techniques of defining ranges or boundaries of race parameters for player's rank classification are studied. The techniques are based on crisp values, neural network, and fuzzy inference process. Then, an entertainment quantifier technique is proposed for a player after playing a certain number of games based on dynamic content generation using multiobjective genetic algorithm using standard Pareto optimal front and an epsilon () front. In conclusion, the method proposed for quantifying entertainment can be used to analyze and classify the trend in interests of a player according to which the game itself can dynamically generate. This will keep the interest of player intact and provides maximum entertainment experience per the interest of an individual. The proposed solution can easily be used in generation of any game content and can effectively be used in accurate measurement of entertaining factor of any game."	computational intelligence; data-driven approach; genetic algorithm; measuring entertainment; Pareto optimal front; particle swarm optimization	Javed, S.; Zafar, K.

164	GameSE_abstract	Development of a user-friendly application for creating tactical role-playing games	Video Game Industry has grown exponentially in the last years. As a consecuence of this evolution, development environments have become more complex toolkits focused on the many features that are common in modern video games. This phenomenon has allowed the emergence of tools that non-technical users can use, making video game development accessible to virtually everyone. Due to the high interest on this type of tools we have decided to develop TRPG Maker, an intuitive and self-contained tool focused on the development of tactical role-playing games for non-technical users without interest on development's technical details. Along with the development of the tool we have carried out a first experimental validation with real users to determine the degree of usefulness and comfort of the tool, as well as to detect failures and discover possible improvements.

165	GameSE_abstract	Real-time strategy synthesis for timed-arc Petri net games via Discretization	Automatic strategy synthesis for a given control objective can be used to generate correct-by-construction controllers of reactive systems. The existing symbolic approach for continuous timed games is a computationally hard task and current tools like UPPAAL TiGa often scale poorly with the model complexity. We suggest an explicit approach for strategy synthesis in the discrete-time setting and show that even for systems with closed guards, the existence of a safety discretetime strategy does not imply the existence of a safety continuous-time strategy and vice versa. Nevertheless, we prove that the answers to the existence of discrete-time and continuous-time safety strategies coincide on a practically motivated subclass of urgent controllers that either react immediately after receiving an environmental input or wait with the decision until a next event is triggered by the environment. We then develop an on-the-fly synthesis algorithm for discrete timed-arc Petri net games. The algorithm is implemented in our tool TAPAAL and based on the experimental evidence, we discuss the advantages of our approach compared to the symbolic continuous-time techniques.

167	GameSE_abstract	Enhanced FFD-AABB collision algorithm for deformable objects	Unlike FEM (Finite Element Method), which provides an accurate deformation of soft objects, FFD (Free Form Deformation) based methods have been widely used for a quick and responsive representation of deformable objects in real-time applications such as computer games, animations, or simulations. The FFD-AABB (Free Form Deformation Axis Aligned Bounding Box) algorithm was also suggested to address the collision handling problems between deformable objects at an interactive rate. This paper proposes an enhanced FFD-AABB algorithm to improve the frame rate of simulation by adding the bounding sphere based collision test between 3D deformable objects. We provide a comparative analysis with previous methods and the result of proposed method shows about an 85% performance improvement.

168	GameSE_abstract	Modeling urban environments from geospatial data: A pipeline for procedural modeling	In game development there is often the need to generate realistic urban environments, i.e. 3D virtual environments that replicate existing urban areas. However, modeling such spaces using traditional techniques is both too slow and too expensive. A good solution is the use of procedural modeling techniques to automate the process. However these techniques require large amounts of geospatial data, which are usually stored in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This paper presents a pipeline for the integration of both geometric and semantic data from GIS data sources into procedural modeling techniques used for the generation of 3D virtual urban environments. GIS data can already be used in procedural modeling tools but these do not provide an easy and uniform way to incorporate semantic information from different data sources. To solve this problem, the proposed pipeline is capable of transforming semantic and geometric information from different sources into 3D environments that replicate specific urban areas.

169	GameSE_abstract	Review and Case Study of the Impact of VR Technology on Internet 3D Game Design	Game users have higher and higher requirements for VR application experience, which makes it an urgent problem for developers to improve the quality of VR application and user experience. Therefore, this paper analyzes the main impact of the current VR technology on Internet games, as well as the main development technology. Then the Virtools technology sets Unity3d engine as a development tool to complete the development of 3D games. Finally, with the help of unity3d engine and 3dsmax modeling software, the whole system development process is realized by using modular design idea. Data aggregation statistics and algorithm analysis are performed to generate monitoring report in the form of visual chart and the test results show that the system runs well. It not only has practical application value, but also has theoretical significance. It can be also extended to other fields such as distributed computing, distributed cooperative work and online game development.	game design; Unity3d; Virtools; VR technology	Jin, G.

170	GameSE_abstract	Towards a Graph-Based Approach for Mesh Healing for Blocky Objects with Self-Similarities	3D digital models are used in a wide range of applications such as computer games, virtual reality, engineering and urban design. A common method to create 3D models is to create a point cloud using laser scanners, structured lighting sensors, or image-based modelling techniques, and from that construct a 3D mesh. The resulting meshes often exhibit unsatisfactory and erroneous mesh regions, e.g. due to inaccessible parts, reflective surfaces, and occlusion. In this paper we present a new approach for correcting erroneous mesh regions in blocky objects, such as buildings, using self-similarities. Our system uses a novel graph-based search technique where each node is a plane fitted to the model using RANSAC and edges are made between adjacent planes. This graph is used to find defects in a mesh by analysing the planes and neighbourhoods of all nodes in the point cloud. The system recognizes a hole in the mesh and fills it by copying matching patches from the same mesh. Regions of the mesh that must be replaced are found by a voting system where dissimilar nodes with a similar neighbourhood vote against each other. Our solution produces visually accurate models of blocky objects with holes and/or missing corners and edges. The approach currently only works for simple models and can only 'heal' individual or connected faces, rather than complex holes. However, in contrast to existing solutions it works with noisy point clouds and does not require the construction of a polygonal modal.	blocky objects; graphs; mesh filling; self-similarities; surface reconstruction	Jones, M.; Hippolite, N.; Patel, R.; Peters, S.; Singh, P.; Chen, C.-Y.; Wunsche, B.C.

172	GameSE_abstract	MobileWars: A mobile GPGPU game	"Nowadays mobile phones, especially smartphones, are equipped with advanced computing capabilities. Most of these devices have multicore processors such as dual-core CPUs and many-core GPUs. These processors are designed for both low power consumption and high performance computation. Moreover, most devices still lack libraries for generic multicore computing usage, such as CUDA or OpenCL. However, computing certain kind of tasks in these mobile GPUs, and other available multicores processors, may be faster and much more efficient than their single threaded CPU counterparts. This advantage can be used in game development to optimize some aspects of a game loop and also include new features. This work presents an architecture designed to process most of the game loop inside a mobile GPU using the Android Renderscript API. As an illustrated test case for the proposed architecture, this work presents a game prototype called ""MobileWars"", completely developed using the proposed architecture."

173	GameSE_abstract	Model based design introduction: Modeling game controllers to microprocessor architectures	We present an introduction to model based design. Model based design is a visual representation, generally a block diagram, to model and incrementally develop a complex system. Model based design is a commonly used design methodology for digital signal processing, control systems, and embedded systems. Model based design's philosophy is: To solve a problem-a step at a time. The approach can be compared to a series of steps to converge to a solution. A block diagram simulation tool allows a design to be simulated with real world measurement data. For example, if an analog control system is being upgraded to a digital control system, the analog sensor input signals can be recorded. The digital control algorithm can be simulated with the real world sensor data. The output from the simulated digital control system can then be compared to the old analog based control system. Model based design can compared to Agile software develop. The Agile software development goal is to develop working software in incremental steps. Progress is measured in completed and tested code units. Progress is measured in model based design by completed and tested blocks. We present a concept for a video game controller and then use model based design to iterate the design towards a working system. We will also describe a model based design effort to develop an OS Friendly Microprocessor Architecture based on the RISC-V.

174	GameSE_abstract	Redefining the mda framework--the pursuit of a game design ontology	In computer science, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject. There have been many attempts to create a widely accepted ontology for the universe of games. Most of these attempts are defined based on an analytical perspective: few have found frequent use outside universities, as they are not easily translated to the development of games, which is a design perspective. There are some core aspects of the domain that turn this task into a difficult goal to achieve. In addition, game designers tend to refuse a methodology or a structured way of developing a game; the main concern is that it can impair creativity in a field that could not survive without it. A defined ontology would improve and mature the growing industry of digital games, both by enhancing the understanding of the domain and by supporting a structured methodology for designing games. This paper describes the properties of digital games and shows how they make it difficult to create an ontology for that field of study, especially when it comes to a design perspective. It clarifies the closest approach to a unified ontology that there is for the game domain: the mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics framework (MDA). We propose the redefinition of MDA's taxonomy, calling it Redefining the MDA (RMDA), providing better use for the approach from a designer's perspective, embracing the design properties of the domain, and overcoming issues found in the literature of the game domain. The main purpose of this paper is to clarify the MDA framework by redefining its main components, mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics, as a way to make the tool more understandable and useful for game designers. Understanding aesthetics and how developers can invoke them by correctly defining mechanics and creating dynamics is the main focus of the paper. Thus, some examples are provided in order to explain the applicability of the RMDA as a methodology to produce games.

175	GameSE_abstract	Between the game system and the fictional World: A study of computer game interfaces	This article discusses the relationship between the user interface (UI) and the game world in computer games, with point of departure in qualitative studies including players and game developers. The developers' evaluation of the relationship from a design point of view will first be presented, before the article goes on to discuss the degree to which the players accept the presence of UI features within the game world. We will see that developers find it challenging to balance between functionality and fiction, but see system features as a necessity that must be present for usability purposes. From the point of departure of players, they rarely consider system features intrusive to the game world, but accept them as integrated to the conventions established within modern computer game aesthetics.	game interface; game world; player studies; qualitative studies; user interface	Jorgensen, K.

It is unique in that it combines the work of teams covering multiple disciplines (art, music, acting, programming, etc.), and that engaging game play is sought after through the use of prototypes and iterations. With that, game development is faced with challenges that can be addressed using traditional SE practices. The industry needs to adopt sound SE practices for their distinct needs such as managing multimedia assets and finding the ""fun"" in game play. The industry must take on the challenges by evolving SE methods to meet their needs. This work investigates these challenges and highlights engineering practices to mitigate these challenges."

JavaStrike is a Java development and execution environment that was developed from scratch inside Unity. The engine currently supports classes, functions, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, key-value stores, and much more. JavaStrike allows code to be displayed, executed, and debugged in the virtual world. We then create a third-person shooter game called CodeBreakers, which leverages the JavaStrike engine. CodeBreakers covers basic programming concepts such as variable types, intermediate programming concepts such as stacks, queues, and hashmaps, and advanced programming concepts such as inheritance, interfaces, and method overriding.

179	GameSE_abstract	Learning the patterns of balance in a multi-player shooter game	A particular challenge of the game design process is when the designer is requested to orchestrate dissimilar elements of games such as visuals, audio, narrative and rules to achieve a specific play experience. Within the domain of adversarial first person shooter games, for instance, a designer must be able to comprehend the differences between the weapons available in the game, and appropriately craft a game level to take advantage of strengths and weaknesses of those weapons. As an initial study towards computationally orchestrating dissimilar content generators in games, this paper presents a computational model which can classify a matchup of a team-based shooter game as balanced or as favoring one or the other team. The computational model uses convolutional neural networks to learn how game balance is affected by the level, represented as an image, and each team's weapon parameters. The model was trained on a corpus of over 50,000 simulated games with artificial agents on a diverse set of levels created by 39 different generators. The results show that the fusion of levels, when processed by a convolutional neural network, and weapon parameters yields an accuracy far above the baseline but also improves accuracy compared to artificial neural networks or models which use partial information, such as only the weapon or only the level as input.

Our geolocative raycasting methods have been applied in the location-based, AR game Order Elimination, which utilizes publicly and freely available building information to calculate the players FoV in real-time. The proposed algorithms are applicable to a variety of sensor-based AR applications and portable to any real setting, provided that sufficient topographical data exist. The three FoV determination methods have been tested with respect to several performance parameters demonstrating that real-time FoV rendering is feasible by modest mobile devices, even under stress conditions. A user evaluation study revealed that the consideration of buildings for determining the FoV in AR pervasive games can increase the quality of experience of players when compared with standard FoV generation methods.

182	GameSE_abstract	Is requirements engineering useless in game development?	"[Context/motivation] Game development is characterized by a high level of creativity when compared to other fields of software development. Games cover a multitude of themes and genres, and represent a heterogeneous group of different products with varying requirements and business goals. [Question/problem] Requirements engineering (RE) should be relevant to game development, but is this true and if it is, how does game industry apply RE in practice? [Principal ideas/Results] We interviewed 27 software professionals in seven organizations to understand how requirements engineering is applied in game developing organizations. The results suggest that in game development business practicalities and drive for ""fun"" dominate the areas associated with requirements engineering. Additionally, game development organizations apply approaches and methods that are comparable to requirements engineering and requirement management, but do not consciously apply common RE practices. [Contribution] This paper extends our understanding of requirements engineering in video game development and contributes to the requirements engineering body of knowledge."	game design; game development; requirements engineering; requirements management	Kasurinen, J.; Maglyas, A.; Smolander, K.

184	GameSE_abstract	Integrating peer-to-peer and cloud computing for massively multiuser online games	Cloud computing has recently become an attractive solution for massively multiplayer online games, also known as MMOGs, as it lifts operators from the burden of buying and maintaining large amount of computational, storage and communication resources, while offering the illusion of infinite scalability. Yet, cloud resources do not come for free: a careful orchestration is needed to minimize the economical cost. This paper proposes a novel architecture for MMOGs that combines an elastic cloud infrastructure with user-provided resources, to boost both the scalability and the economical sustainability provided by cloud computing. Our system dynamically reconfigures the platform while managing the trade-off between economical cost and quality of service, exploiting user-provided resources whenever possible. Simulation results show that a negligible reduction in the quality of service can reduce the cost of the platform up to 60 % percent.

185	GameSE_abstract	Designing semantic game worlds	Current game worlds often fall short in providing consistency between the visual representation of the world and the way it feels, behaves, and reacts. This problem partly originates from the goal-oriented and cost-effective nature of the game development process, which mostly favors ad hoc solutions for one particular game, rather than investing in concepts like reusability and emergent gameplay. In broader terms, we observe that game worlds miss semantics, and we argue that its deployment has the potential to bring about the consistency missing in their content. Therefore, we present a novel approach aimed at enriching virtual entities in game worlds with information about their roles, how they relate to others, and how they can affect and interact with players, NPCs, and with each other. We discuss several requirements to achieve these goals, and introduce a semantic model to represent game worlds. In order to support and validate this model, we have developed Entika, a framework to facilitate the deployment of semantics during game development, as well as its maintenance during run-time. Furthermore, we briefly discuss several applications that demonstrate the power of this semantic model for game worlds. After careful evaluation of our semantic game world model and framework, we conclude that a semantically rich world representation can substantially assist designers in creating much more consistent game worlds.

Users now have a great variety of mobile game applications but their usability is not guaranteed. Among many other game applications, android casual game applications are very 'in' these days. Bubble shooter concept based games are selected for this study, being the casual game applications. As there was no usability framework for these types of games, so usability questionnaire framework is developed to test their usability on android games audience. Secondly usability improvement framework is also suggested to improve these games and is also the outcome of the study along with the questionnaire framework.	android smart phones; bubble shooter games; casual game applications; human computer interaction; mobile computing; usability engineering	Khan, J.S.; Arif, F.; Mohsin, A.

187	GameSE_abstract	Recovery of mobile game design patterns	The benefits of design patterns to solve recurring and generic problems is well known for the software industry and academia. Game design patterns are being introduced to solve the particular type of problems for the development of computer games. The formal and informal specifications of game design patterns exist because of differences in implementation, design requirements and programming languages. We analyzed the state of the art related to mobile game design patterns and realized that mobile applications are developed by using mobile game design patterns for the development of quality software applications. The recovery of mobile game design patterns is helpful for the comprehension, reverse engineering, maintenance, evolution and refactoring of software applications. The contribution of this paper are specification and detection of 10 mobile game design patterns from 8 open source mobile games. A prototyping tool is developed to demonstrate the concept of the approach. We evaluate our approach by using precision, recall and F-measure metrics.

188	GameSE_abstract	Tailoring Scrum Methodology for Game Development	The closest comparison of video game development would be other types of software development such as application software development or system software development. Yet these comparisons do not do it any justice. A video game is more than a software or the sum of its parts, unlike other types of software. In video games there is a much larger emphasis on performance, system requirements are often subjective. Designing a video game also tends to be a lot harder due to the complex interactions between the objects and the end users. The same is true when it comes to testing video games. Whereas other software developers can get away with functional and meeting all the requirements, in due time, a video game also has to provide the target audience with entertainment value.

189	GameSE_abstract	DeepStreak: Automating Car Racing Games for Self Driving using Artificial Intelligence	Commercial Video games are becoming popular with the advent of Artificial Intelligence. Most of the online or offline video games are passive i.e. they strictly follow the scripted instructions. And then there are trending competitions in AI-based games that need to generate auto-scripts and auto-interactions to adapt to the dynamic scenario, improve performance and also resolve the challenges which are faced in real-time. Hence there is a need to develop new techniques with intelligence which can have a significant impact on the gaming industry. Thus, this paper discusses the list of challenges and research opportunities available for developing new AI techniques that can be used by computer game developers and proposes techniques to completely automate the video games using three different approaches including key points being data augmentation and segmentation techniques followed by feeding data to CNNs.

190	GameSE_abstract	First person movement control with palm normal and hand gesture interaction in virtual reality	Virtual reality (VR) has become a very popular technology in recent years, which used in the field of multimedia for various purposes. One of the applications that widely used for simulating physical presence in the real world is walk-through VR. In the walk-through VR system will generate simulation character or avatar for user which able to control movement, especially first person movement walk-through in VR with many input devices. In this paper, we present a human-computer interaction with the connection of Oculus Rift and Leap Motion new technological devices for VR. Oculus Rift is VR headset or head-mounted display devices that have a small display optic in front of each eye. Oculus Rift can track head movement and change view point follow it. Leap Motion is in-air controller that can track hand gesture of the user. The combination of them will make users feel like immerse to VR. Users can move avatar any way in VR by their hand interact through the system via these devices. We introduce a new interactive hand gesture system with palm normal for control steering develop by the game engine Unity3D applies synchronization of Oculus Rift and Leap Motion. Our design and development method will allow users to adjust moving speed follows the hand gesture and the range of the user's hand that make a smoothly moving with acceleration.

191	GameSE_abstract	Nerfs, buffs and bugs - Analysis of the impact of patching on league of legends	While traditional software patches primarily fix bugs, modern online computer games use patches to change gameplay, as well. Despite the importance of gameplay changes for both game players and game designers, to the best of our knowledge, there are no published results nor available 3rd party Websites that analyze game data and patch data. We analyzed the effects of patches on gameplay in League of Legends (LoL), a popular online game created by Riot Games. Our methods: a) harvested all available patch data - over 160 patches with over 7700 changes - classifying patches based on a novel taxonomy; b) gathered game statistics from over 11,000 players in over 465,000 games; and c) analyzed both the patch data and game data, with emphasis on correlations. In addition, we developed a publicly accessible Web site that allows for interactive exploration of the game data and patch data. Analysis of the data shows that Riot patches LoL gameplay an average of twice each day, about ten times more often than Riot patches LoL bugs. Patches tend to keep all player-chosen champions close to a win rate of 50%. While most patch gameplay changes can be categorized and even quantified numerically, the impact of combined changes are not always straightforward and interpretation of patch text is required in order to understand the full impact.

192	GameSE_abstract	Capturing game telemetry with provenance	The outcome of a game session is derived from a series of events, decisions, and interactions that are made during the game. Many processes and techniques have been developed by the game industry in order to understand this outcome. A successful method is game analytics, which aims at understanding the player behavior patterns to improve game quality and enhance the player experience. However, the current methods for analytics are not sufficient to capture the underlying cause-And-effect influences that shape the outcome of a game session. These relationships allow developers and designers to better identify possible mistakes in the gameplay design or to fine-Tune their games. In a recent work, Kohwalter et al. introduced a conceptual framework based on provenance to capture these relationships and manually instantiated such framework in some games. In this paper, we propose a concrete component for capturing provenance data and the cause-And-effect relationships among game objects, and for automatically building the correspondent provenance graph. This provenance data allows a more powerful support for the visual game analytics. We implemented our component in the Unity game engine and show two case studies over open-source games.

Therefore, they have attracted considerable research interest. This paper investigates novel multi-objective neuroevolutionary approaches for fighting games focusing on the Fighting Game AI Competition. Considering several objectives shall improve the AI's generalization capabilities when confronted with new opponents.To this end, novel combinations of neuroevolution and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are explored. Since the variants proposed employ the well-known R2 indicator, we derived a novel faster algorithm for determining the exact R2 contribution. An experimental comparison of the novel variants to existing multi-objective neuroevolutionary algorithms demonstrates clear performance benefits on the test case considered. The best performing algorithm is then used to evolve controllers for the fighting game. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art AI opponents shows very promising results; the novel bot is able to outperform several competitors.

196	GameSE_abstract	Understanding the Interplay of Model Complexity and Fidelity in Multiagent Systems via an Evolutionary Framework	Modern video games come with highly realistic graphics enabling the players to interact with visually rich virtual worlds. Realistic (life-like) animation of nonplayer characters (NPCs) in such virtual worlds is particularly important to enhance the gaming experience. Multiagent systems are one effective approach to synthesize life-like behaviors and interactions by codifying simple rules into NPCs (each NPC as an autonomous agent). However, such behaviors generally come at the cost of increasing computational expense and complexity in terms of aspects such as number of rules and parameters. Therefore, the desire for high fidelity (highly realistic) behaviors is often in conflict with the drive for low complexity. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms provide a sophisticated mechanism to optimize two or more conflicting objectives simultaneously. However, evolutionary computing techniques need an appropriate objective function to drive the exploration in the correct direction. Pairing of evolutionary techniques and multiagent systems is challenging in the classes of problems in which the fitness is evaluated based on human aesthetic judgment rather than on objective forms of measurements. In this study, we present a multiobjective evolutionary framework to evolve low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems by utilizing a machine learning system trained by bootstrapping human aesthetic judgment. We have gathered empirical data in three problem areas - simulation of conversational group dynamics, sheepdog herding behaviors, and traffic dynamics, and show the effectiveness of our approach in deriving low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems. Further, we have identified common properties of the Pareto-optimal frontiers in the three problem areas that can ultimately lead to an understanding of a relationship between simulation model complexity and behavior fidelity. This understanding will be useful in deciding which level of behavioral fidelity is required for the characters in video games based on the distance to the camera, importance to the scene, and available computational resources.

Yet, a lot of research has been done on the subject, and successful complex behaviors have been created, but the systems used are too complicated to be used by the video games industry, as they would need time for the game designer to learn how they function, which ultimately proves prohibitive. Moreover these systems often lack control for the game designer to be adapted to the desired behavior. To address the issue, we propose an accessible strategy model that can adapt itself to the player and can be easily created and modified by the game designer.

199	GameSE_abstract	Striving for author-friendly procedural dialogue generation: Paper	This paper reports on an ongoing attempt to develop an author friendly approach to procedural game dialogue generation. Various affordances of the experimental authoring tool Expressionist are appropriated to allow non-computer scientist authors to design virtual characters' discourse and reasoning potential. The paper describes how the Hammurabi game project makes use of metadatadriven context free grammars to author virtual characters that can generate not only discourse but also context-relevant decisions. The author-friendliness and generativity of the approach is discussed.

200	GameSE_abstract	Scamper: Generating test suites to maximise code coverage in interactive fiction games	We present ScAmPER, a tool that generates test suites that maximise coverage for a class of interactive fiction computer games from the early 1980s. These games customise a base game engine with scripts written in a simple language. The tool uses a heuristic-guided search to evaluate whether these lines of code can in fact be executed during gameplay and, if so, outputs a sequence of game inputs that achieves this. Equivalently, the tool can be seen as attempting to generate a set of test cases that maximises coverage of the scripted code. The tool also generates a visualisation of the search process.

202	GameSE_abstract	Create game opponent from UCT-created data and neuro-evalution	Adaptive Game AI improves adaptability of opponent AI as well as the challenge level of the gameplay; as a result the entertainment of game is augmented. Opponent game AI is usually implemented by scripted rules in video games, but the most updated algorithm of UCT (Upper Confidence bound for Trees) which perform excellent in computer go can also be used to achieve excellent result to control nonplayer characters (NPCs) in video games. However, due to computational intensiveness of UCT, it is actually not suitable for Online Games. As we have already known that UCT can create near optimal data [9, and 10], we could create Neuro-Controller for Game Opponent using off-line learning from the UCT created sample data, then use the Controller for Online Games without worrying about the computational efficiency. And also with if the optimization approach of Neuro-Evolution is applied to the above created Neuro-Controller, the performance of the opponent AI is enhanced further. In this paper, the prey and predator game genre of Dead End is used as a test-bed, the basic principle of UCT is presented, and the effectiveness of its application to game AI development is demonstrated. The experiment compares the performance of different NPCs control approaches: given 300 milliseconds for each simulation step, the approach of optimized Neuro-controller perform the best, which is better than either the no-optimized Neuro-controller or the UCT-controller.

203	GameSE_abstract	Adaptive difficulty scales for parkour games	Mobile computer games have become increasingly popular in recent years. A major factor for successful game development is the adequate control of the game's difficulty. This paper discusses justification for dynamic difficulty adaption for Parkour games. It presents an adaptive mechanism for difficulty adjustment in response to the player's run-time performance in the single player mode. The mechanism is based on game content generation techniques, considering constrains for mobile screens. Both the functionality of the game's objects and the player's psychological and behavioral inclinations are taken into consideration. Our preliminary experiment shows that game experiences are significantly enhanced with the adaption mechanism.	Difficulty adaption; Mobile games; Parkour	Li, Y.-N.; Yao, C.; Li, D.-J.; Zhang, K.

204	GameSE_abstract	A Robust Watermarking Algorithm for Video Game Artwork Based on Pose Estimation Neural Network	Video game artworks serve a crucial role in video game development, the associated copyright protection remain largely unsolved. We propose a robust watermarking for protecting the copyright of video game artwork. Specifically, the watermarking algorithm uses pose estimation neural network to select pose joint points, and construct feature areas with the pose joint points as the center. Compared with existing local feature watermarking methods, the pose joint points are selected by the pose estimation neural network are much more evenly distributed, stable and orderly. Next non-maximum suppression (NMS) is used to select non-overlapping feature areas. Then discrete Wavelet transformation (DWT) performs on each feature area, and then dividing each sub-band into blocks. Finally, each block is decomposed by QR decomposition and select R matrix to embed watermarks. In the extraction procedure, the video game artwork is corrected using affine transformation before extraction. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of imperceptiblity, robustness and computational cost. The algorithm is robust to common image attacks and geometric attacks, can effectively resist special attacks including text addition, tampering weapon, and cutting body parts of video game artwork.

205	GameSE_abstract	A new approach to multiplayer virtual reality games	Virtual reality (VR) games represent a new world for players and game developers alike. As developers continue to work in this field, they continually look for new ways to immerse players in the VR gaming world. Plenty of challenges arise in the effort to troubleshoot and solve new problems that come with the development of virtual reality. Consumer satisfaction is extremely important, and game developers constantly work to improve and enhance the player experience. In this paper, we simulate the behavioral relations for the multiplayer game of logical decision making in humans and computers. We provide a model of strategic interaction between rational decision-makers for designing and developing the multiplayer virtual reality game. Our game sets in the real-world and tries to allow reasonable and logical solutions to a problem to result in success.	Design; Games; Multiplayer; Virtual reality	Lin, A.J.; Chen, C.B.; Cheng, F.

206	GameSE_abstract	Using deep convolutional neural networks to detect rendered glitches in video games	In this paper, we present a method using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to detect common glitches in video games. The problem setting consists of an image (800x800 RGB) as input to be classified into one of five defined classes, normal image, or one of four different kinds of glitches (stretched, low resolution, missing and placeholder textures). Using a supervised approach, we train a ShuffleNetV2 using generated data. This work focuses on detecting texture graphical anomalies achieving arguably good performance with an accuracy of 86.8%, detecting 88% of the glitches with a false positive rate of 8.7%, and with the models being able to generalize and detect glitches even in unseen objects. We apply a confidence measure as well to tackle the issue with false positives as well as an effective way of aggregating images to achieve better detection in production. The main use of this work is the partial automatization of graphical testing in the final stages of video game development.

207	GameSE_abstract	Self-validated behaviour trees through reflective components	Developing the AI for non-player characters in a video game is a collaborative task between programmers and designers. Most of the times, there is a tension between the freedom that designers require to include their narrative in the game and the effort required from programmers to debug faulty AI specified by good story tellers who are not programmers. In this paper is presented an architecture for building the AI of an NPC that extends the component-based approach, which represents the functionality of an entity as a collection of functionality-specific components. By associating an action in a behaviour tree with a collection of components, and equipping those components with some reflection capabilities, we are able to identify faulty behaviour trees at design time.

208	GameSE_abstract	Iterative software design of computer games through FCA	If iteration is the rule in modern software development practices, this is more the case in game development. While the secret recipe for fun in games remains hidden, game development will remain a highly iterative trial-and-error design process. In this paper we present a semi-automatic process that, through FCA, can assist in the software design of modern videogames. Through FCA we can identify candidate distributions of responsibilities among components, and let the users edit such distributions. We support iteration by facilitating the application of past edits when going through a new iteration of identifying candidate components to accommodate for new version of the game requirements.

209	GameSE_abstract	Knowledge guided development of videogames	Due to the changing nature of videogames, the componentbased architecture is the design of choice for managing game entities instead of the traditional static class hierarchies. A component-based architecture lets programmers edit entities as collections of components, which provide the entity with new functionalities. Such architecture promotes flexibility but makes the code more difficult to understand because entities are built at runtime by linking components. In this paper we present a semi-automatic process for moving from a class hierarchy to a component-based architecture. Through the application of Formal Concept Analysis we propose a novel technique for automatically identifying candidate distributions of responsibilities among components.

210	GameSE_abstract	Explicit domain modelling in video games	The state-of-the-art in software engineering for game engines, recommends the use of a component-based software architecture for managing the entities in a game. A component-based architecture facilitates the definition of new types of entities as collections of components that provide basic pieces of functionality, providing a flexible software that can adapt to changes in game design. However, such flexibility comes with a price, both in terms of software understanding and error checking: a game where entity types are just run-time concepts is harder to understand than one with an explicit hierarchy of entity types; and error checking that, in a more traditional inheritance-based architecture, would come from type safety at compile time is now lost. To alleviate these problems, a component-based architecture employs blueprints, external data files that specify the particular combination of components for every entity type. In this paper we propose an extension to the componentbased architecture, substituting blueprints with a full fledged domain model in OWL, including a description of the entities, its attributes and components, along with the messages they exchange. We also describe authoring tools for building such a model and show how the model improves software understanding and error checking.

211	GameSE_abstract	Automated Tests for Mobile Games: An Experience Report	As mobile gaming is an ever-growing, competitive and profitable market, there has been an increasing demand for better quality in video game software. While manual testing is still a common practice among mobile game developers, some repetitive and error-prone tasks could benefit from test automation. For instance, test scripts that perform sanity checks of the proper functioning of a mobile game would be desirable in an ecosystem with constant hotfixes and updates, as well as a diverse set of configurations (e.g., device hardware, screensizes, and platforms). In this context, this paper reports an experience on developing automated test scripts for mobile games. To this end, we randomly selected 16 mobile games, from different genres, among the popular ones from the Google Play Store. For each game, test scripts were developed using the Appium testing framework and the OpenCV library. Based on our results, we provide an in-depth discussion on the challenges and lessons learned.

212	GameSE_abstract	A novel data hiding algorithm for game texture based on hamming+1	Game texture image is an important resource in game development. In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to copyright protection technology in the computer game. Data hiding method can be used to add some secret messages in the game texture image. To solve the copyright protection of game texture image, a novel data hiding algorithm based on Hamming +1 technology is proposed in this paper. The secret messages are embedded into the modulation information of PVRTC (PowerVR Texture Compression) texture format which is popular in computer game. Due to the coding rules of the PVRTC texture format, the decompressed image quality will be reduced after secret messages are embedded. So the optimization mechanism is applied to improve the image quality. The experimental results show that this method is effective and can be applied to the copyright protection of the game texture images.

214	GameSE_abstract	SuBViS: The use of subjunctive visual programming environments for exploring alternatives in game development	Game development is a naturally iterative process where many ideas are tested and prototyped before final decisions are made. Given the increased usage of visual scripting systems in game development recently, it is apparent that these tools must be able to support every aspect of this process. One aspect that is not well captured is the exploration of alternatives. SuBViS was developed as a solution to this problem. It is a visual scripting system for exploring parallel ideas in game development through the use of alternatives at graph and node levels. These two levels of exploring alternatives can be combined or used separately. This paper presents a use case example, which demonstrates how SuBViS can improve workflow and communication between team members. It also discusses a small-scale user study and the results obtained therein. SuBViS was developed on top of Unreal Engine's existing Blueprint Visual Scripting system.

215	GameSE_abstract	Multi agent based approach to assist the design process of 3D game environments	Designing complex and reasonable 3D environments for modern 3D games is one of the time consuming challenges faced by present video game industry. We have critically reviewed the existing approaches to automate the design of 3D environments. It was identified that current 3D environment generation techniques being specific to one or few types of environments and the lack of customizable frameworks which are common to many types of environments as the main issues to be addressed. According to literature, surprisingly complex and interesting global behaviours can arise in multi agent systems as a result of simple rules that are followed by number of simple agents operate in an environment. We hypothesize that this emergent behaviour of multi agent systems can be used to design 3D game environments with emergence properties that were not visible in initial constituents. The proposed solution provides a multi agent based approach to develop a framework which is common to design many types of 3D game environments. Each 3D model in a 3D game environment is associated with an agent with simple rules and this system allows users to introduce new 3D models and associate them with agent types. The main input for the proposed system is a parameterized description of an imaginary 3D environment. Output of the system is a 3D game environment with self organized 3D models positioned and oriented in most suitable places. The proposed approach has been evaluated by implementing a prototype and comparing the proposed approach with traditional 3D game environment design approaches.	3D Game Development; Artificial Intelligence; Emergent Intelligence; Game Design; Multi Agent Systems	Maddegoda, R.; Karunananda, A.S.

216	GameSE_abstract	SMASH: A distributed game engine architecture	In these last few years we are witnessing a change in the way video games are implemented. Starting from an early age, where a single developer was sometimes in charge of the whole creative process, we have moved now toward extremely large groups with a multi-layered organisation. This increasing complexity of team organisation, together with a tremendous growth of projects size, calls for the adoptions of development approaches leveraging on scalability and distributed computing environments. Unfortunately, today's development and execution environments for games (usually called game engines) are suffering from a number of architectural constraints. As a result, we strongly believe current engines will not be able to provide the flexibility and scalability required by game developers of the next generation. To overcome the above limitations, in this paper we propose SMASH (Stackless Microkernel Architecture for SHared environments): an architecture where a game engine is decomposed in several dynamic and independent software modules interacting via a microkernel-like message bus. Game modules can just be inserted, debugged, and removed from a running engine once its internal messaging protocol is clearly defined. Moreover, following this approach, game modules can be dynamically dislocated on multiple machines to obtain a truly distributed, scalable, and fault-resilient system where adaptation can be achieved mostly without downtime.

217	GameSE_abstract	Development of a software library for game artificial intelligence	Today, technologies of artificial neural networks are very popular and are used in various fields and tasks, such as pattern recognition, classification. To create artificial neural networks, constructors or software libraries for machine learning can be used. However, they do not always contain the necessary functions. In some cases, you need to write your own software library to solve non-standard tasks. The article discusses the development of a software library for creating artificial neural networks. Using the developed library is demonstrated in the task of implementing the game artificial intelligence of the opponent in a simple computer game 'Tic-tac-toe'. The effectiveness of the opponent's game is compared with the implementations of opponents based on the minimax algorithm and the random behavior algorithm.

218	GameSE_abstract	A game engine to make games as multi-agent systems	Video games are applications that present design patterns that resemble multi-agent systems. Game objects or actors are like autonomous agents that interact with each other to describe complex systems. The purpose of this work is to develop a game engine to build games as multi-agent systems. The actors or game engine agents have a set of properties and behaviour rules with the end to interact with the environment of the game. The behaviour definition is established through a formal semantic based on predicate logic. The proposed engine tries to fulfil the basic requirements of the multi-agent systems, by adjusting the characteristics of the system, without affecting its potential. Finally, a set of games are introduced to validate the operation and possibilities of the engine.

219	GameSE_abstract	A First Step to Specify Arcade Games as Multi-agent Systems	The lack of formalities in the development of video games is one of the main obstacles for the incorporation of new professionals to the field. Although there are general proposals to describe and specify video games with techniques such as Game Design Document or Game Description Language, these are usually aimed at implementations in predetermined media, which determines the game specification from the outset to its implementation in the selected platform. This paper proposes a method for the definition, specification and implementation of a video game based on multi-agent systems, where its elements, functionalities and interactions are established independently of the platform used for its development. To prove its validity and capabilities, the classic arcade game Frogger has been used as a demonstrator. This game has been defined in its general form and subsequently implemented on three different platforms following the same specification. Each of these implementations has been made using different engines, languages and programming techniques, but in any case, meeting the requirements of the game and multi-agent systems.

220	GameSE_abstract	A Game Logic Specification Proposal for 2D Video Games	The game engines are one of the essential and daily used applications on game development. These applications are designed to assist in the creation of games' contents. However, the games definition and specification is still complex. The mechanisms involved in the behaviour definition are not easy to standardise, given their dependency with the subjective game logic design and the selected programming language features. In this sense, this work presents the design and development of a game logic system for 2D video games. It draws from the study and analysis of the behaviour and game logic definition literature. From this, a game logic system has been developed from a first-order logic semantics and a reduced set of actions and conditions. The model has been tested with several games to determine its potential. Finally, one of these games is described with the proposed semantics, and further on it is also used as a reference for a user test against other game logic systems.

221	GameSE_abstract	A Multi-agent Specification for the Tetris Game	In the video game development industry, tasks related to design and specification require support to translate game features into implementations. These support systems must clearly define the elements, functionalities, and interactions of the game elements, and they must also be established independently of the target platform for its development. Based on a study for the specification of games that allows the generation of games as multi-agent systems, this work tries to check if the results can be cross-platform applied. As a case study the classic game Tetris has been used, a game whose very nature suggests that its implementation should be composed of vector and matrix data structures. The purpose is to validate the usage of a game specification based on multi-agent systems for the game's implementation on different platforms.

222	GameSE_abstract	Virtual reality sickness detection: An approach based on physiological signals and machine learning	Virtual Reality (VR) is spreading to the general public but still has a major issue: VR sickness. To take it into consideration and minimize its occurrence, evaluation methods are required. The current methods are mainly based on subjective measurements and therefore have several drawbacks (e.g., non-continuous, intrusive). Physiological signals combined with Machine Learning (ML) methods seem an interesting approach to go beyond these limits. In this paper, we present a large-scale experimentation (103 participants) where physiological data (cardiac and electrodermal activities) and subjective data (perceived VR sickness) were gathered during 30-minute VR video game sessions. Using ML methods, models were trained to predict VR sickness level (based on the physiological data labeled with the subjective data). Results showed an explained variance up to 75% (in a regression approach) and an accuracy up to 91% (in a classification approach). Despite generalization issues, this method seems promising and valuable for a real time, automatic and continuous evaluation of VR sickness, based on physiological signals and ML models.

223	GameSE_abstract	CustomConsole: A framework for supporting cross-device videogames	Nowadays it is increasingly common to own multiple devices such as laptops, smartphones or tablets. Distributed User Interfaces (DUS) leverage the simultaneous use of various devices to interact with different applications. However, no previous work has studied the use of DUS for videogames. Videogames are one of the largest industry but have requirements different from those of regular applications. CustomConsole is a framework to interconnect multiple devices and create custom gaming systems. CustomConsole games define different roles; each role has associated inputs and outputs: pointing or buttons are inputs whereas views or listeners are outputs. Players can select their role and distribute the associated inputs and outputs across the available devices. We present an initial design of the framework and a use case of a CustomConsole game.

224	GameSE_abstract	Audible mapper & shadowrine: Development of map editor using only sound in accessible game for blind users, and accessible action RPG for visually impaired gamers	Although many computer games have recently become diversified, plenty of effort and ingenuity is needed to produce games that persons with a total visual impairment can enjoy. Though some games for visually impaired persons have been developed, games that use only auditory information present challenges for sighted persons. Moreover, unfortunately, it is still difficult for visually impaired persons to play the same game with sighted persons and for sighted and visually impaired persons to share a common subject. To solve this problem, we developed a barrier-free game that both sighted and visually impaired persons can play using their dominant senses including visual, auditory and tactile senses. Moreover, we developed a map editor for a game developer with blindness and provided an integrated game development environment for them. In this paper, we describe the development and reflections of the barrier-free game and the map editor.	2D representation; Inclusive game; Integrated game development environment for the blind; Tactile map; Visually impaired persons	Matsuo, M.; Miura, T.; Sakajiri, M.; Onishi, J.; Ono, T.

226	GameSE_abstract	Software engineering practices and methods in the game development industry	Applying current software engineering practices in the game development industry is a rapidly growing but under researched area. Whether game development studios align to traditional software engineering practices such as agile methodologies to develop their games is not known. It is also unknown how studios perceive their own adherence to such agile development practices. Furthermore, struggling start-up studios could benefit from implementing development practices based on the experiences of established studios. Hence, an exploratory survey was conducted to determine the practice of, and perception of agile game development in New Zealand. The results show that while studios universally state and perceive that they use the agile framework Scrum and sometimes Kanban, their actual practices often differ from these frameworks in key areas. Furthermore, studios collectively overestimated their level of adherence with Scrum. This has general implications for related academic studies as well as for the game industry's own evaluation and improvement of their practices.

227	GameSE_abstract	Is Agile Not Agile Enough? A Study on How Agile is Applied and Misapplied in the Video Game Development Industry	Video games have become the most dominant and successful entertainment industry worldwide; however, many video game development (VGD) projects and studios struggle to succeed. At present, there are no commonly accepted VGD best practices or frameworks that can bring together the complex and competing needs of software engineering and creative production. Although studios are reportedly using agile frameworks, the actual extent of application and effectiveness of agile practices in the VGD context is unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study is to empirically determine how and why agile frameworks are applied in VGD. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight New Zealand VGD studios. It was found that the agile frameworks, Scrum and Kanban, must often be adapted from their conventional use to meet the needs of different pipelines and delivery milestones within the phases of VGD. However, it seems that not all the needs of VGD can be met by current agile frameworks. Furthermore, inexperience with agile practices often leads to misunderstanding and misimplementing them in ways that seem to contribute to commonly experienced collaboration challenges.

228	GameSE_abstract	WAVE: Interactive Wave-based Sound Propagation for Virtual Environments	We present an interactive wave-based sound propagation system that generates accurate, realistic sound in virtual environments for dynamic (moving) sources and listeners. We propose a novel algorithm to accurately solve the wave equation for dynamic sources and listeners using a combination of precomputation techniques and GPU-based runtime evaluation. Our system can handle large environments typically used in VR applications, compute spatial sound corresponding to listener's motion (including head tracking) and handle both omnidirectional and directional sources, all at interactive rates. As compared to prior wave-based techniques applied to large scenes with moving sources, we observe significant improvement in runtime memory. The overall sound-propagation and rendering system has been integrated with the Half-Life 2 game engine, Oculus-Rift head-mounted display, and the Xbox game controller to enable users to experience high-quality acoustic effects (e.g., amplification, diffraction low-passing, high-order scattering) and spatial audio, based on their interactions in the VR application. We provide the results of preliminary user evaluations, conducted to study the impact of wave-based acoustic effects and spatial audio on users' navigation performance in virtual environments.	directivity; dynamic sources; Helmholtz equation; Sound propagation; spatial sound	Mehra, R.; Rungta, A.; Golas, A.; Lin, M.; Manocha, D.

229	GameSE_abstract	Developing video games with elementary adaptive artificial intelligence in unity: An intelligent systems approach	Video games have increasingly demonstrated a great deal of audiovisual realism, in par with the massive performance improvement of computer systems. At the same time, their Artificial Intelligence (AI) component falls short in terms of realism because it is usually based on non-adaptive methods. Adaptive AI mechanisms can help increase video game realism allowing the game to adapt in real-time to the game progress and the user behavior. Following a short overview of the progress of AI in video games in the past years, this paper highlights the creation of modern video games with basic and elementary adaptive game AI using the Unity game development framework. Particular emphasis is on the details of the AI component. First, a shooter game with basic AI is created. Finally, an action-adventure video game is created featuring elementary case-based adaptive AI. The objective in this game is to create enemies which are able to perceive changes in the environment and adapt their strategies accordingly. Proposed AI practices can migrate into relevant real world applications, such as video surveillance and intrusion detection systems, mission critical autonomous networked patrolling and/or save and rescue robots, vision and hearing assistive applications, intelligent video and behavioral analytics to detect and predict threats etc.	adaptive game AI; case-based adaptive game AI; game AI; intrusion detection; networked patrolling robots; Unity	Meliones, A.; Plas, I.	2017 Intelligent Systems Conference, IntelliSys 2017	https://doi.org/10.1109/IntelliSys.2017.8324230		104-111		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen		AI: Studies that were focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI).	2	Scopus	2018	Developing Video Games With Elementary Adaptive Artificial Intelligence In Unity: An Intelligent Systems Approach	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051092383&doi=10.1109%2fIntelliSys.2017.8324230&partnerID=40&md5=bc3b1458c891565bb6a88fe126fc628c	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc	nan; Venue; References; Year; Bibtex
230	GameSE_abstract	Performance analysis of game engines on mobile and fixed devices	"Mobile gaming is an emerging concept wherein gamers are using mobile devices, like smartphones and tablets, to play best-seller games. Compared to dedicated gaming boxes or PCs, these devices still fall short of executing newly complex 3D video games with a rich immersion. Three novel solutions, relying on cloud computing infrastructure, namely, computation offloading, cloud gaming, and client-server architecture, will represent the next generation of game engine architecture aiming at improving the gaming experience. The basis of these aforementioned solutions is the distribution of the game code over different devices (including set-top boxes, PCs, and servers). In order to know how the game code should be distributed, advanced knowledge of game engines is required. By consequence, dissecting and analyzing game engine performances will surely help to better understand how to move in these new directions (i.e., distribute game code), which is so far missing in the literature. Aiming at filling this gap, we propose in this article to analyze and evaluate one of the famous engines in the market, that is, ""Unity 3D.""We begin by detailing the architecture and the game logic of game engines. Then, we propose a test-bed to evaluate the CPU and GPU consumption per frame and per module for nine representative games on three platforms, namely, a stand-alone computer, embedded systems, and web players. Based on the obtained results and observations, we build a valued graph of each module, composing the Unity 3D architecture, which reflects the internal flow and CPU consumption. Finally, we made a comparison in terms of CPU consumption between these architectures."

231	GameSE_abstract	Playtesting for indie Studios	Creating video games is a lengthy and demanding process. Financial success for games studios often depends on making games that deliver a fun and engaging experience for a diverse audience of players. Therefore, understanding how players interact and behave during gameplay is of vital importance. Playtesting aims to assist developers to achieve their design intent and help to identify and resolve potential problem areas during development. However, playtests are not always feasible or affordable for smaller, independent game developers (indie studios) because they require specialized equipment and expertise. In addition to this, there is a lack of research on the value of playtesting for indie studios, which means most indie developers are not convinced of the value of user research and playtesting. This paper reports on our collaboration with six commercial indie developers conducting eleven rounds of playtesting session. Through these collaborations, our paper contributes to this growing domain by highlighting the value of playtesting for indie developers and discussing the user research process and approaches based on indie developers' needs and budget.

232	GameSE_abstract	A Postmortem on Playtesting: Exploring the Impact of Playtesting on the Critical Reception of Video Games	"Game studios aim to develop titles that deliver a fun and engaging experience for players. Playtesting promises to help identify opportunities to improve player experience and assist developers in achieving their design intent. However, a lack of research on the added value of playtesting means that many studios are still uncertain about its commercial viability and impact on product success. This gap in understanding is further complicated by the vague definition of ""success"" afforded by sales figures and review scores. In this paper, we assess reported feature quality of three commercial titles by analyzing playtesting reports and game reviews. By comparing themes and design issues expressed in game reviews to the results of pre-release playtesting for each game, we aim to highlight the value of playtesting and propose a set of guidelines for selecting playtest methods based on the needs of a given game evaluation. Through the real-world case studies presented, this paper contributes to the growing domain of games user research and highlights the value of playtesting in game development."	game reviews; games user research; playtesting	Mirza-Babaei, P.; Stahlke, S.; Wallner, G.; Nova, A.

233	GameSE_abstract	Decreasing rework in video games development from a software engineering perspective	Video game industry is becoming increasingly important due to its revenues and growing capabilities. Information complexity and process agility are limitations for developing a videogame and they may lead to rework. Many rework problems are related to unspecified or ambiguous requirements in game design. For reducing rework, this article proposes an agile development process for video games that aligns the Scrum instance of the software development Project Pattern (sdPP) and the improved Game Design Document (iGDD). For measuring the rework induced by different alternatives, we conducted a case study that compares the proposed approach against a conventional counter proposal in game industry; the results prove that our proposal generates less normalized rework than the counter proposal.

234	GameSE_abstract	Developing game AI agent behaving like human by mixing reinforcement learning and supervised learning	Artificial intelligence (AI) agent created with Deep Q-Networks (DQN) can defeat human agents in video games. Despite its high performance, DQN often exhibits odd behaviors, which could be immersion-breaking against the purpose of creating game AI. Moreover, DQN is capable of reacting to the game environment much faster than humans, making itself invincible (thus not fun to play with) in certain types of games. On the other hand, supervised learning framework trains an AI agent using historical play data of human agents as training data. Supervised learning agent exhibits a more human-like behavior than reinforcement learning agents because of imitating training data. However, its performance is often no better than human agents. The ultimate purpose of AI agents is to entertain human players. A good performance and a humanlike behavior are important factors of the AI agents, and both of them should be achieved simultaneously. This study proposes frameworks combining reinforcement learning and supervised learning and we call then separated network model and shared network model. We evaluated their performances by the game scores and behaviors by Turing test. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed frameworks develop an AI agent of better performance than human agent and natural behavior than reinforcement learning agents.

235	GameSE_abstract	Software architecture for digital game mechanics: A systematic literature review	Game mechanics, the rules that simulate the virtual world inside a game, take a great part in what makes a game unique. For digital games, this uniqueness reduces the opportunity for software reuse. A high-level software architecture for game mechanics, however, can still be reused where a single, specific implementation cannot. Despite that potential, existing research on game development lacks a comprehensive analysis of how game mechanics could benefit from the field of software architecture. This limits the opportunities for developers and researchers alike to benefit from findings on the subject. To help guide future research on game development, we analyzed the state-of-the-art architectures in game mechanics through a systematic literature review. This work carefully documents data from 36 studies, analyzing the reflections and compromises between design requirements, practices, and restrictions, as well as how they contribute to different types of mechanics. The main findings are that researchers favor reduced development complexity, but often tailor their solutions to specific games or genres. We conclude that a valuable avenue for future research in the field is the generalization of architectural solutions around specific types of mechanics and formalizing the use of software engineering for game mechanics.

236	GameSE_abstract	Redefining game engine architecture through concurrency	Over the past 30 years, software developers have been conveniently taking advantage of hardware performance increase, giving little consideration to internal architecture changes of the hardware like central processing unit. In the years to come, these hardware architectural changes will affect software architectures and can no longer be ignored. This is especially true for real-time applications, which tend to push the limits of hardware and take the most advantage of available resources. As a result, computer game applications which are inherently real-time and known for pushing computer hardware boundaries will not be immune. By studying the concepts of concurrency, multithreading and multi-core CPU technology, this paper redefines the existing linear architecture of game engines as a generic concurrent and multi-core friendly architecture. Major game engine modules and their inter-dependencies are identified in order to design the new architecture. A sample game was developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture. The comparison of the test results provided in this paper indicates noticeable improvements in the concurrent architecture over the conventional linear approach.

238	GameSE_abstract	A context-aware architecture for improving collaboration of users in Groupware systems	A Context-Aware Groupware System (CAGS) enables the members of a team to communicate, cooperate and coordinate their activities to achieve a common goal, by providing them tools that are aware of their current execution context and adapt accordingly. CAGS can be found in several domains such as entertainment, particularly Collaborative First-Person-Shooter (FPS) video games. In CAGS, the means of collaboration traditionally provided to users (e.g. text and audio messaging) are not necessarily adequate: for instance, in a FPS, messages can distract the gamer due to the speed of the game. This paper reports a study that, for Collaborative FPS, identifies advantages/disadvantages of current means of collaboration and social behaviors that arise when players interact face-to-face or remotely. Based on this study, a context-aware conceptual model and architecture is proposed for CAGS aimed to improve user collaboration.

240	GameSE_abstract	AR markerless game	The concept of augmented reality markerless tracking is introduced. This concept provides a flexible and practical framework and is especially relevant for video game augmented reality applications. Markerless AR has been comprised of the universal communal. Markerless augmented reality is the encounter proficiency that's now prepared for the primary time. The perception of this report is that the handler's aspect at the live appearance of the camera of their portable phone in three dimensional and the passage that they see that is the certainty is developed by assimilated three- dimensional virtual objects. Augmented reality games have the authority to outspread virtual gaming into real-world circumstances with real people, while improving the senses of the user. This paper designates the AR-zombie game established with the purpose of detected and unindustrialized mobile augmented reality submissions, precisely for gaming, using ground plane detection collaboration techniques. The objective of the AR zombie player is to kill zombies that are identified through the demonstration of the device. Instead of using indicators as a mean of tracking zombies, this game integrates a ground plane detection system, which will augment the user experience by improving the interface of performers with the real world. As the player travels around the environment, the game will show virtual zombies on the display if the detected ground plane is predictable as belonging to the class of the zombies. AR zombie was tested with users to evaluate the interaction with the real world and its types of tracks were evaluated concerning the presentation to confirm a better gaming familiarity.

241	GameSE_abstract	Cowboys, ankle sprains, and keepers of quality: How is video game development different from software development?	Video games make up an important part of the software industry, yet the software engineering community rarely studies video games. This imbalance is a problem if video game development differs from general software development, as some game experts suggest. In this paper we describe a study with 14 interviewees and 364 survey respondents. The study elicited substantial differences between video game development and other software development. For example, in game development, cowboy coders are necessary to cope with the continuous interplay between creative desires and technical constraints. Consequently, game developers are hesitant to use automated testing because of these tests rapid obsolescence in the face of shifting creative desires of game designers. These differences between game and non-game development have implications for research, industry, and practice. For instance, as a starting point for impacting game development, researchers could create testing tools that enable game developers to create tests that assert flexible behavior with little up-front investment.	games; practices; Software engineering	Murphy-Hill, E.; Zimmermann, T.; Nagappan, N.

242	GameSE_abstract	Improving video game development: Facilitating heterogeneous team collaboration through flexible software processes	Based on our observations of Austrian video game software development (VGSD) practices we identified a lack of systematic processes/method support and inefficient collaboration between various involved disciplines, i.e. engineers and artists. VGSD includes heterogeneous disciplines, e.g. creative arts, game/content design, and software. Nevertheless, improving team collaboration and process support is an ongoing challenge to enable a comprehensive view on game development projects. Lessons learned from software engineering practices can help game developers to increase game development processes within a heterogeneous environment. Based on a state of the practice survey in the Austrian games industry, this paper presents (a) first results with focus on process/method support and (b) suggests a candidate flexible process approach based on Scrum to improve VGSD and team collaboration. Results showed (a) a trend to highly flexible software processes involving various disciplines and (b) identified the suggested flexible process approach as feasible and useful for project application.

243	GameSE_abstract	Game programmers with secure coding	The purpose of this paper is to introduce software security for online games at two levels: first at the programming level and second at the web service level. Increasingly game developers are providing their games online, employing web services; however, security threats evolve with the use of web services in such applications which is a great challenge for game developers. The roadblock to providing secure game applications is the lack of understanding of secure coding concepts by game programmers. In this paper we propose the 5W1H re-documentation technique and the use of the Scrum agile software development methodology in a reengineering process to educate game programmers concerning secure coding concepts. The authors first prove how insecure coding can affect the gaming industry by introducing an example of an insecure game login application. Then the same login application is re-documented and reengineered with secure coding concepts. The reengineered application is then tested for security threats.	5W1H; Agile software development methodology; Scrum; Secure coding; Service-Oriented computing; Software re-documnetation; Software reengineering; Web services	Nagmoti, R.; Chung, S.; Endicott-Popovsky, B.

244	GameSE_abstract	A requirements analysis for videogame design support tools	Designing videogames involves weaving together systems of rules, called game mechanics, which support and structure compelling player experiences. Thus a significant portion of game design involves reasoning about the effects of different potential game mechanics on player experience. Unlike some design fields, such as architecture and mechanical design, that have CAD tools to support designers in reasoning about and visualizing designs, game designers have no tools for reasoning about and visualizing systems of game mechanics. In this paper we perform a requirements analysis for design-support tool for game design. We develop a proposal in two phases. First, we review the designsupport- system and game-design literatures to arrive at a plausible system that helps designers reason about game mechanics and gameplay. We then refine these requirements in a study of three teams of game designers, investigating their current design problems and gauging interest in our tool proposals and reactions to prototype tools. Our study finds that a game design assistant that is able to formally reason about abstract game mechanics would provide significant leverage to designers during multiple stages of the design process.

In this paper, AI controllers are applied to the Mario AI benchmark platform, by using the grammatical evolution system to evolve behavior tree structures. These controllers are either evolved to both deal with navigation and reactiveness to elements of the game or used in conjunction with a dynamic A* approach. The results obtained highlight the applicability of behavior trees as representations for evolutionary computation and their flexibility for incorporation of diverse algorithms to deal with specific aspects of bot control in game environments.

247	GameSE_abstract	Join token-based event handling: A comprehensive framework for game programming	"In action game programming, programmers have to control multiple concurrent activities on the screen corresponding to multiple game characters. To address this difficulty, many game-oriented scripting languages have been proposed so far. However, current scripting languages seem to lack support for interactions among multiple concurrent activities in a state-dependent manner. To overcome this problem, we propose an event handling framework called ""join token"" in which the states of game characters can be expressed as tokens and interactions can be described as handlers specifying multiple tokens. For the purpose of evaluation, we have developed a game scripting language called ""Mogemoge,"" and wrote several sample games in this language. In this paper, we describe experiences of using join token framework for sample games and compare the code written in Mogemoge against a code written in an existing scripting language."	event handling framework; programming language; scripting language; video game	Nishimori, T.; Kuno, Y.

249	GameSE_abstract	Objects and their participation in the interdisciplinary design and development of computer games	This paper investigates the role of boundary objects in the interdisciplinary collaborative processes found in computer games development. It draws on data from an in-depth case study in a computer games studio that explores boundary objects in relation to the compelling, sensory and entertainmentcentred game-playing practices that inform computer games design and development. Sensory user experience and aesthetic considerations - of primary importance in computer games development - are becoming increasingly significant in the design and development of many other kinds of software and information systems. For this reason developments in the design and production of computer games have wider implications for other software and information systems settings and provide valuable insights into processes of collaboration that bridge cultural and aesthetic as well as technical forms of expertise. The paper seeks to provide insights into how objects contribute to such collaboration, with attention focusing especially on how game developers devise objects that span boundaries and draw on these in their collaboration. Through its focus on the material production and practices of computer games development, the research presented also seeks to contribute to the theoretical treatment of interdisciplinary collaborative working in software design and development via a critical assessment of the concept of boundary objects in the setting being studied.

250	GameSE_abstract	Towards adaptive deep reinforcement game balancing	The experience of a player regarding the difficulty of a video game is one of the main reasons for he/she decide to keep playing the game or abandon it. Effectively, player retention is one of the primary concerns related to the game development process. However, the experience of a player with a game is unique, making impractical to anticipate how they will face the gameplay. This work leverages the recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Learning (DL) to create intelligent agents that are able to adapt to the abilities of distinct players. We focus on balancing the difficulty of the game based on the information that the agent observes from the 3D environment as well as the current state of the game. In order to design an agent that learns how to act while still maintaining the balancing, we propose a reward function based on a balancing constant. We require that the agent remains inside a range around this constant during the training. Our experimental results show that by using such a reward function and combining information from different types of players it is possible to have adaptable agents that fit the player.

251	GameSE_abstract	Exploring games as formal models	Computer games have become increasingly complex. Modern game specifications need to accommodate many detailed design documents, which results in increasing complexity. Complex games are difficult to understand, maintain and update, but their software cannot be extensively functional, as this might confuse the player. Consequently, game developers can benefit from following precise guidelines to design games for players. Formal methods can provide a suitable specification environment to formalize static and dynamic game aspects and realistically model game rules and events. At a higher level of abstraction, a formal game model can provide understandability and communication of the activities within a development process.

252	GameSE_abstract	Applying Lehman's laws to game evolution	Computer games are a genre of software systems that in many ways differs from more traditional applications. In particular, when designing games, the end result of game development resembles work of art rather than that of engineering, emphasizing the need for creativity and artistic abilities. However, as technology, tools, methods, and artifacts that are used in the development of games are to a large extent similar to those used in the development of more traditional system, games should conform to the basic laws of software, including software evolution. In this paper, we reflect the principles of software evolution distilled by Manny Lehman in the form of laws of software evolution to the game domain. We present how the laws can be interpreted and applied in games projects, and argue that many of the laws apply to many games, but not all laws apply to all games. The way the game is evolved especially has an effect on the applicable laws as changes in games can be emerging, reactive or pre-planned.

253	GameSE_abstract	A model-driven approach to generate and deploy videogames on multiple platforms	Currently, videogame development for mobile devices is a highly profitable and competitive industry worldwide. This profitability can be ascribed to the popularity that new technologies such as smartphones and tablets have acquired over the last few years. To increase competitiveness, we use a model driven engineering (MDE) approach to develop multi-platform videogames in a quick and easy manner. MDE helps us to reduce the number of errors, the amount of time required and the development costs and favors a productivity increment. The aim of this work is to present an approach for the agile development of multi-platform videogames by using high-level abstraction models. We offer a feasible solution supported by a tool that allows the development of videogames in a simple and agile way. An empirical validation is presented through a use case where the viability of our approach is shown in comparison with that of other tools. Finally, a survey shows the users' perception of the solution with the objective of validating the use case results. The given use case indicates that our approach is suitable for improving videogame development. The survey indicates that users think that it is possible to model videogames and generate the corresponding applications with our approach.

254	GameSE_abstract	Evolution and Evaluation of the Model-View-Controller Architecture in Games	In game software it is important to separate game play code from rendering code to ease transitions to new technologies or different platforms. The architectural pattern Model-View-Controller (MVC) is commonly used to achieve such separation. We investigate how the MVC architectural pattern is implemented in five game projects from a small development studio. We define a metrics-based quality model to assess software quality goals such as portability and rendering engine independence and perform an architectural analysis. The analysis reveals three different evolutions of the pattern. We also assess the quality and find that 1. The evolutions of the architecture differ in quality and 2. An architectural refactoring to a newer version of the architecture increases the software quality.

255	GameSE_abstract	Evaluation of a static architectural conformance checking method in a line of computer games	We present an evaluation of a simple method to find ar- chitectural problems in a product line of computer games. The method uses dependencies (direct, indirect, or no) to automatically classify types in the implementation to high- level components in the product line architecture. We use a commercially available tool to analyse dependencies in the source code. The automatic classification of types is com- pared to a manual classification by the developer, and all mismatches are reported. To evaluate the method, we inspect the source code and look for a pre-defined set of architectural problems in all types. We compare the set of types that contained problems to the set of types where the manual and automatic classification disagreed to determine precision and recall. We also investigate what changes are needed to correct the found mismatches by either designing and implementing changes in the source code or refining the automatic classification. Our evaluation shows that the simple method is effective at detecting architectural problems in a product line of four games. The method is lightweight, customisable and easy to implement early in the development cycle.

256	GameSE_abstract	Automatic difficulty management and testing in games using a framework based on behavior trees and genetic algorithms	The diversity of agent behaviors is an important topic for the quality of video games and virtual environments in general. Offering the most compelling experience for users with different skills is a difficult task, and usually needs important manual human effort for tuning existing code. This can get even harder when dealing with adaptive difficulty systems. Our paper's main purpose is to create a framework that can automatically create behaviors for game agents of different difficulty classes and enough diversity. In parallel with this, a second purpose is to create more automated tests for showing defects in the source code or possible logic exploits with less human effort.

257	GameSE_abstract	Proposing a Hybrid Methodology for Game Development	The invention of video games has been transferred the meaning of ancient games into digitalized software games. The period of games leading to the definition of video games. Nowadays, this kind of digitalized games can be played on any device. That is evolving games can be an uncreative business. To up keeping the industry of games development, much unique original equipment manufacturer (OEM) openly distribute their software development kit (SDK) and application programming interface (API) to inspire individuals to develop 'indie developer'. The game is a kind of software with the goal to provide entertainment. However, during the real game development practice, simply adopting the software development lifecycle (SDLC) is not enough, as the developers face several challenges during its life cycle. To address the problem, game development uses a kind of specific approach called game development life cycle (GDLC) to direct the game development. However, none of the existing DLC clearly address how to successfully deliver a good quality game. This research presents a hybrid game development model and guidelines to successfully deliver a good quality game. Several quality standards as are clearly considered at each phase (Jain, S (2017)).

258	GameSE_abstract	Event normalization methodology for computer game environment simulation	Computer gaming is a key component of the rapidly growing entertainment industry. Computer games are a multi-billion pound worldwide part of the entertainment industry. However, they are a relatively new type of software product and as such the manner in which they are designed and developed is still evolving. Computer games can be highly complex software systems that involve the expertise of a wide range of professionals ranging from programmers to animators, artists and musicians. When designing computer games, new game concepts can be difficult to communicate. In addition, the creative process could be benefited if game design ideas were capable of being shared widely and discussed. In this paper, we are to some extent shifting the focus from real world situation to what we shall term game world situation. That is, a logically simulated environment is created by defining situations and events based on the hierarchy structure of the situation. Our study defines event type, causality events and event normalization, and aims to develop a logical simulation method. These methods allow us to understand the communication of new game environment design. Specially, the introduction of the definition of events allows us to approach game design in a structural manner rather than by their classification. The proposed method was implemented in the context of changing among natural phenomena in a game environment.	Causality; Events; Game environment design; Logical simulation	Park, J.-Y.; Park, J.-H.

However, the creative processing additionally has the benefit if the new concepts of the computer games are widely used and discussed. We focus on understanding the ideas to be shared between the game designer and the game programmer in the game design. The research defines a graph-based representation of game scenarios is in terms of Event graph, State graph, and Action graph forms in order to minimize anomalies of game flow design. This method in our research can reduce unexpected and undesirable game situations. Also it reduces the mismatched information between the game designer and the game programmer in game-playing. Compared with the existing method such as storyboard, flowchart, and SSM, we demonstrate the viability of our game design methodology.

260	GameSE_abstract	Evaluation of an automatically-constructed graph-based representation for interactive narrative	Interactivity and player experience are inextricably entwined with the creation of compelling narratives for interactive digital media. Narrative shapes and buttresses many such experiences, and therefore designers must construct compelling narrative arcs while carefully considering the effects of interaction on both the story and the player. As the narrative becomes more structurally complex, due to choice-based branching and other player actions, designers need to employ commensurately capable models and visualizations to keep track of that growing complexity. However, previous models of interactive narrative have failed to fully capture interactive elements with automated, operationalized visualizations. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for automated construction of a framework-driven, graph-based representation of interactive narrative. This representation more fully and transparently models structural and interactive features of the narrative than did prior approaches. We present an initial evaluation of this representation, based on modified cognitive walkthroughs performed by interactive narrative design and research experts from our research team, and we describe the takeaways for future improvement on interactive narrative modeling and analysis.

261	GameSE_abstract	How is video game development different from software development in open source?	Recent research has provided evidence that, in the industrial context, developing video games diverges from developing software systems in other domains, such as office suites and system utilities. In this paper, we consider video game development in the open source system (OSS) context. Specifically, we investigate how developers contribute to video games vs. non-games by working on different kinds of artifacts, how they handle malfunctions, and how they perceive the development process of their projects. To this purpose, we conducted a mixed, qualitative and quantitative study on a broad suite of 60 OSS projects. Our results confirm the existence of significant differences between game and non-game development, in terms of how project resources are organized and in the diversity of developers' specializations. Moreover, game developers responding to our survey perceive more difficulties than other developers when reusing code as well as performing automated testing, and they lack a clear overview of their system's requirements.	empirical studies; mining software repositories; video games	Pascarella, L.; Palomba, F.; Di Penta, M.; Bacchelli, A.

The ideas presented in this publication aim to provide a scalable solution not just to the end product but also to the code base in order to ensure greater ease in future maintainability and expansion.	debug; hierarchy; Multi-player; scalable; synchronization	Pedersen, K.; Gatzidis, C.; Northern, B.	2013 3rd International Workshop on Games and Software Engineering: Engineering Computer Games to Enable Positive, Progressive Change, GAS 2013 - Proceedings	https://doi.org/10.1109/GAS.2013.6632589		40-43		Included	Excluded	new_screen		AI: Studies that were focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI).	2	Scopus	2013	Distributed Deepthought: Synchronising Complex Network Multi-Player Games In A Scalable And Flexible Manner	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84890089690&doi=10.1109%2fGAS.2013.6632589&partnerID=40&md5=eb92da478152d6485d14d51927b0da5e	IEEE	nan; Venue; References; Year; Bibtex
263	GameSE_abstract	A Framework for Branched Storytelling and Matchmaking in Multiplayer Games	Video games often either have good single player campaign modes or good multi-player campaign-less modes. This paper presents a framework aimed at the full game development pipeline, from designers to programmers, to aid in creating multiplayer campaigns by providing components that help singleplayer story modes to be used in multiplayer interaction settings. We also propose a custom matchmaking system capable of matching players so as to intertwine their individual stories. The proposed framework has been validated in a case study. A set of experimental results show that the framework is capable of producing valuable story crossings and proper matchmaking.

264	GameSE_abstract	Toward foraging for understanding of StarCraft agents: An empirical study	"Assessing and understanding intelligent agents is a difficult task for users that lack an AI background. A relatively new area, called ""Explainable AI,"" is emerging to help address this problem, but little is known about how users would forage through information an explanation system might offer. To inform the development of Explainable AI systems, we conducted a formative study - using the lens of Information Foraging Theory - into how experienced users foraged in the domain of StarCraft to assess an agent. Our results showed that participants faced difficult foraging problems. These foraging problems caused participants to entirely miss events that were important to them, reluctantiy choose to ignore actions they did not want to ignore, and bear high cognitive, navigation, and information costs to access the information they needed."

265	GameSE_abstract	Building a dynamic social community with non playable characters	A challenge faced by the video game industry is to develop believable and more intelligent Non-Playable Characters (NPCs). To tackle this problem a low-cost and simple approach has been proposed in this research, which is the development of a gossip virtual social network for NPCs. The network allows simple individual NPCs to communicate their knowledge amongst themselves. The communication within this social network is governed by social-psychological rules. These rules are categorized into four types: Contact, whether the NPC are within a contactable range of each other; Observation, whether the NPCs actually want to talk to each other based on their personal traits; Status, the current representation of the NPCs; and Relationships which determines the long term ties of the NPCs. Evaluations of the proposed gossip virtual social network was conducted, both through statistical analysis and a survey of real users. Highly satisfactory results have been achieved.

266	GameSE_abstract	Automated game testing with ICARUS: Intelligent completion of adventure riddles via unsupervised solving	With ICARUS, we introduce a framework for autonomous video game playing, testing, and bug reporting. We report on the design rationale, the practical implementation, and its use in game development industry projects. With ICARUS, we introduce a framework for autonomous video game playing, testing, and bug reporting. We report on the design rationale, the practical implementation, and its use in game development industry projects. The underlying solving mechanic is based on discrete reinforcement learning in a dualistic fashion, encompassing volatile short-term memory as well as persistent long-term memory that spans across distinct game iterations. In combination with heuristics that reduce the search space and the possibility to employ pre-defined situation-dependent action choices, the system manages to traverse complete playthrough iterations in roughly the same amount of time that a professional game tester requires for a speedrun. The ICARUS project was developed at Daedalic Entertainment. The software can be used to generically run all adventure games built with the popular Visionaire Engine [6] and is currently used for evaluating daily builds, for large-scale hardware compatibility and performance tests, as well as for semi-supervised quality assurance playthroughs. The supplementary video depicts real-time solving with active control and observation via a web control panel.

267	GameSE_abstract	Towards deep player behavior models in MMORPGs	Due to a steady increase in popularity, player demands for video game content are growing to an extent at which consistency and novelty in challenges are hard to attain. Problems in balancing and error-coping accumulate. To tackle these challenges, we introduce deep player behavior models, applying machine learning techniques to individual, atomic decision-making strategies. We discuss their potential application in personalized challenges, autonomous game testing, human agent substitution, and online crime detection. Results from a pilot study that was carried out with the massively multiplayer online role-playing game Lineage II depict a benchmark between hidden markov models, decision trees, and deep learning. Data analysis and individual reports indicate that deep learning can be employed to provide adequate models of individual player behavior with high accuracy for predicting skill-use and a high correlation in recreating strategies from previously recorded data.

268	GameSE_abstract	Dungeons Replicants: Automated Game Balancing via Deep Player Behavior Modeling	Balancing the options available to players in a way that ensures rich variety and viability is a vital factor for the success of any video game, and particularly competitive multiplayer games. Traditionally, this balancing act requires extensive periods of expert analysis, play testing and debates. While automated gameplay is able to predict outcomes of parameter changes, current approaches mainly rely on heuristic or optimal strategies to generate agent behavior. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of deep player behavior models to represent a player population (n = 213) of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game Aion, which are used, in turn, to generate individual agent behaviors. Results demonstrate significant balance differences in opposing enemy encounters and show how these can be regulated. Moreover, the analytic methods proposed are applied to identify the balance relationships between classes when fighting against each other, reflecting the original developers' design.

This entices a higher level of engagement and immersion among players, an effect of great interest by the electronic game industry. Game engines have been employed by this industry to overcome several challenges and are a well established solution. However, ubigames still lack a solution that handles both the challenges of game development and those faced by ubiquitous computing applications. Here is presented a game engine that helps building such games, providing transparent dynamic integration of heterogeneous devices and technologies for game developers.

270	GameSE_abstract	Are the Old Days Gone? A Survey on Actual Software Engineering Processes in Video Game Industry	"In the past 10 years, several researches studied video game development process who proposed approaches to improve the way how games are developed. These approaches usually adopt agile methodologies because of claims that traditional practices and the waterfall process are gone. However, are the ""old days"" really gone in the game industry? In this paper, we present a survey of software engineering processes in video game industry from postmortem project analyses. We analyzed 20 postmortems from Gamasutra Portal. We extracted their processes and modelled them through using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). This work presents three main contributions. First, a postmortem analysis methodology to identify and extract project processes. Second, the study main result: the ""old days"" are gone, but not completely. Iterative practices are increasing and are applied to at least 65% of projects in which 45% of this projects explicitly adopted Agile practices. However, waterfall process is still applied at least 30% of projects. Finally, we discuss some implications, directions and opportunities for video game development community."

271	GameSE_abstract	Dataset of Video Game Development Problems	Different from traditional software development, there is little information about the software-engineering process and techniques in video-game development. One popular way to share knowledge among the video-game developers' community is the publishing of postmortems, which are documents summarizing what happened during the video-game development project. However, these documents are written without formal structure and often providing disparate information. Through this paper, we provide developers and researchers with grounded dataset describing software-engineering problems in video-game development extracted from postmortems. We created the dataset using an iterative method through which we manually coded more than 200 postmortems spanning 20 years (1998 to 2018) and extracted 1,035 problems related to software engineering while maintaining traceability links to the postmortems. We grouped the problems in 20 different types. This dataset is useful to understand the problems faced by developers during video-game development, providing researchers and practitioners a starting point to study video-game development in the context of software engineering.

272	GameSE_abstract	Improving Engagement Assessment in Gameplay Testing Sessions using IoT Sensors	The video game industry is a multimillionaire market, which makes solo indie developers millionaire in one day. However, success in the game industry is not a coincidence. Video game development is an unusual kind of software that mix multidisciplinary teams: software engineers, designers, and artists. Also, for a video game to become popular, it must be fun and polished: exhaustively well tested. Testing in video game development encompasses different types of tests at different moments of the development process. In particular, assessing the players' gameplay in a test session can drive the development drastically. The designers analyze the players' actions and behaviour in the game. They can then decide if a feature/level requires rework. They often spend many man/work hours reworking a feature just because it is not engaging. As the designers (usually) assess the gameplay session by hand, they cannot be sure that a specific feature is engaging enough. They would benefit from meaningful data that would help them better assess the gameplay and take the decision to keep, rework, or remove a feature. Consequently, we describe the need for an IoT framework to assess players' gameplay using IoT sensors together with game devices which will produce a rich output for the game designers.	game-design; game-development; gameplay; iot; sensors; testing	Politowski, C.; Petrillo, F.; Gueheneuc, Y.-G.

273	GameSE_abstract	Game industry problems: An extensive analysis of the gray literature	Context: Given its competitiveness, the video-game industry has a closed-source culture. Hence, little is known about the problems faced by game developers. However, game developers do share information about their game projects through postmortems, which describe informally what happened during the projects. Objective: The software-engineering research community and game developers would benefit from a state of the problems of the video game industry, in particular the problems faced by game developers, their evolution in time, and their root causes. This state of the practice would allow researchers and practitioners to work towards solving these problems. Method: We analyzed 200 postmortems from 1997 to 2019, resulting in 927 problems divided into 20 types. Through our analysis, we described the overall landscape of game industry problems in the past 23 years and how these problems evolved over the years. We also give details on the most common problems, their root causes, and possible solutions. We finally discuss suggestions for future projects. Results: We observe that (1) the game industry suffers from management and production problems in the same proportion; (2) management problems decreased over the years, giving space to business problems, while production problems remained constant; (3a) technical and game design problems are decreasing over the years, the latter only after the last decade; (3b) problems related to the team increase over the last decade; (3c) marketing problems are the ones that had the biggest increase over the 23 years compared to other problem types; (4) finally, the majority of the main root causes are related to people, not technologies. Conclusions: In this paper, we provide a state of the practice for researchers to understand and study video-game development problems. We also offer suggestions to help practitioners to avoid the most common problems in future projects.

A three-perspective study	Game engines help developers create video games and avoid duplication of code and effort, like frameworks for traditional software systems. In this paper, we explore open-source game engines along three perspectives: literature, code, and human. First, we explore and summarize the academic literature on game engines. Second, we compare the characteristics of the 282 most popular engines and the 282 most popular frameworks in GitHub. Finally, we survey 124 engine developers about their experience with the development of their engines. We report that: (1) Game engines are not well-studied in software-engineering research with few studies having engines as object of research. (2) Open-source game engines are slightly larger in terms of size and complexity and less popular and engaging than traditional frameworks. Their programming languages differ greatly from frameworks. Engine projects have shorter histories with less releases. (3) Developers perceive game engines as different from traditional frameworks.

275	GameSE_abstract	Rapid modeling of human-defined AI behavior patterns in games	The creation of computer and videogames is a challenging and multidisciplinary endeavor, requiring different approaches to integrate different disciplines while keeping relatively low development costs. In this context, domain specific languages (DSLs) are increasingly becoming a valid tool, allowing nonprogrammers to participate in the development process. In this work, we focus on a DSL developed within the Gade4all project, focused on defining the behaviors of non-player characters, proposing a design which allows the participation of users with a lack of programming knowledge to define behavior and interaction complex patterns of in-game enemies in a simple and straightforward way. This preferable to other approaches to defining opponent AIs in games, such as machine learning techniques (which produce advanced AI opponents that do not behave as humans) or rigid rule systems created by programmers rather than behavioral experts. The approach has been tested by comparing the creation of well-known AI patterns using T2GAME with popular game editors, and resulted in significantly reduced development times, in addition to being more approachable for non-programmers such as behavioral psychologists.

276	GameSE_abstract	Aplib: An agent programming library for testing games	Testing modern computer games is notoriously hard. Highly dynamic behavior, inherent non-determinism, and fine grained interactivity blow up their state space; too large for traditional automated testing techniques. An agent-based testing approach offers an alternative as agents' goal driven planning, adaptivity, and reasoning ability can provide an extra edge. This paper provides a summary of aplib, a Java library for programming intelligent test agents, featuring tactical programming as an abstract way to exert control on agents' underlying reasoning based behavior. Aplib is implemented in such a way to provide the fluency of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) while still staying in Java, and hence aplib programmers will keep all the advantages that Java programmers get: rich language features and a whole array of development tools.

277	GameSE_abstract	Aplib: Tactical Agents for Testing Computer Games	Modern interactive software, such as computer games, employ complex user interfaces. Although these user interfaces make the games attractive and powerful, unfortunately they also make them extremely difficult to test. Not only do we have to deal with their functional complexity, but also the fine grained interactivity of their user interface blows up their interaction space, so that traditional automated testing techniques have trouble handling it. An agent-based testing approach offers an alternative solution: agents' goal driven planning, adaptivity, and reasoning ability can provide an extra edge towards effective navigation in complex interaction space. This paper presents aplib, a Java library for programming intelligent test agents, featuring novel tactical programming as an abstract way to exert control over agents' underlying reasoning-based behavior. This type of control is suitable for programming testing tasks. Aplib is implemented in such a way to provide the fluency of a Domain Specific Language (DSL). Its embedded DSL approach also means that aplib programmers will get al.l the advantages that Java programmers get: rich language features and a whole array of development tools.

278	GameSE_abstract	Navigation and exploration in 3D-game automated play testing	To enable automated software testing, the ability to automatically navigate to a state of interest and to explore all, or at least sufficient number of, instances of such a state is fundamental. When testing a computer game the problem has an extra dimension, namely the virtual world where the game is played on. This world often plays a dominant role in constraining which logical states are reachable, and how to reach them. So, any automated testing algorithm for computer games will inevitably need a layer that deals with navigation on a virtual world. Unlike e.g. navigating through the GUI of a typical web-based application, navigating over a virtual world is much more challenging. This paper discusses how concepts from geometry and graph-based path finding can be applied in the context of game testing to solve the problem of automated navigation and exploration. As a proof of concept, the paper also briefly discusses the implementation of the proposed approach.	agent-based testing; automated game testing; automated play testing	Prasetya, I.S.W.B.; Voshol, M.; Tanis, T.; Smits, A.; Smit, B.; Mourik, J.V.; Klunder, M.; Hoogmoed, F.; Hinlopen, S.; Casteren, A.V.; Berg, J.V.D.; Prasetya, N.G.W.Y.; Shirzadehhajimahmood, S.; Ansari, S.G.

279	GameSE_abstract	Dynamic simulation of grass field swaying in wind	Grass is an essential element of natural scenes, which plays an important role in various fields of applications, such as virtual reality, computer games and special effects of movie. Unfortunately, it is still difficult to render and animate grass with interactive frame rates due to the huge number and wide covering range of grass blades. Realistic simulation of dynamic grass field turns to be one of the most challenging topics in computer graphics. In this paper, we propose a method for dynamic simulation of grass field swaying in wind. The representation of large-scale grassland relies on three different levels of detail that reduce the rendering cost and still allow high-fidelity rendering of grass close to the viewer. To simulate real-time waggle of grasses, some physically based methods and procedural approaches are put forward according to different levels of detail. Experiments demonstrate that our method not only can realistically render the animated grass scenes in wind, but also can support the variable wind field.

282	GameSE_abstract	Effects of Image-Based Rendering and Reconstruction on Game Developers Efficiency, Game Performance, and Gaming Experience	Image-based rendering and reconstruction (IBR) approaches minimize time and costs to develop video-game assets, aiming to assist small game studios and indie game developers survive in the competitive video-game industry. To further investigate the interplay of IBR on developers' efficiency, game performance, and players' gaming experience we conducted two evaluation studies: a comparative, ecologically valid study with professional game developers who created games with and without an IBR-based game development pipeline, and a user study, based on eye-tracking and A/B testing, with gamers who played the developed games. The analysis of the results indicates that IBR tools provide a credible solution for creating low cost video game assets in short time, sacrificing game performance though. From a player's perspective, we note that the IBR approach influenced players' preference and gaming experience within contexts of varying levels of player's visual intersections related to the IBR-created game assets.

283	GameSE_abstract	Art critic: Multisignal vision and speech interaction system in a gaming context	True immersion of a player within a game can only occur when the world simulated looks and behaves as close to reality as possible. This implies that the game must correctly read and understand, among other things, the player's focus, attitude toward the objects/persons in focus, gestures, and speech. In this paper, we proposed a novel system that integrates eye gaze estimation, head pose estimation, facial expression recognition, speech recognition, and text-to-speech components for use in real-time games. Both the eye gaze and head pose components utilize underlying 3-D models, and our novel head pose estimation algorithm uniquely combines scene flow with a generic head model. The facial expression recognition module uses the local binary patterns with three orthogonal planes approach on the 2-D shape index domain rather than the pixel domain, resulting in improved classification. Our system has also been extended to use a pan-tilt-zoom camera driven by the Kinect, allowing us to track a moving player. A test game, Art Critic, is also presented, which not only demonstrates the utility of our system but also provides a template for player/non-player character (NPC) interaction in a gaming context. The player alters his/her view of the 3-D world using head pose, looks at paintings/NPCs using eye gaze, and makes an evaluation based on the player's expression and speech. The NPC artist will respond with facial expression and synthetic speech based on its personality. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the system are performed to illustrate the system's effectiveness.

284	GameSE_abstract	Towards Machine-Learning Assisted Asset Generation for Games: A Study on Pixel Art Sprite Sheets	Game development is simultaneously a technical and an artistic challenge. The past two decades have brought many improvements to general-purpose game engines, reducing the new games development effort considerably. However, the amount of artistic work per title has continuously grown ever since, as a result of increased audience's expectations. The cost of asset-making is further increased based on the aesthetics chosen by the design team and the availability of professionals capable of understanding the nuances of the specific visual language chosen. In this paper, we dig into the topic of deep-learning assets generation to reduce the costs of the asset making pipeline, a major concern for game development teams. More specifically, we tackle the challenge of generating pixel art sprites from line art sketches using state-of-the-art image translation techniques. We set this work within the pipeline of Trajes Fatais: Suits of Fate, a 2D pixel-art fighting game inspired by the late nineties classics of the fighting genre. The results show that our deep-learning assets generation technique is able to generate sprites that look similar to those created by the artists' team. Moreover, by means of qualitative and quantitative analyses, as well as character designers evaluation, we demonstrate the similarity of the generated results to the ground truth.

285	GameSE_abstract	A platform-independent model for videogame gameplay specification	Videogames require a more precise specification language to define and communicate gameplay than rules written in natural language. The proposed platform-independent model for videogame gameplay specification offers game designers a precise model to describe, analyze and communicate gameplay from early stages of development. The social context diagram defines how many players and teams interact with the game system. The structure diagram defines the game elements, attributes and events that compose the game system. And the rule set defines the game system behavior, implicitly specifying gameplay through precisely defined declarative rules.

286	GameSE_abstract	Modeling dynamic interaction in virtual environments and the evaluation of dynamic virtual fixtures	"Virtual reality (VR) is a technology covering a large field of applications among which are sports and video games. In both gaming and sporting VR applications, interaction techniques involve specific gestures such as catching or striking. However, such dynamic gestures are not currently being recognized as elementary task primitives, and have therefore not been investigated as such. In this paper, we propose a framework for the analysis of interaction in dynamic virtual environments (DVEs). This framework is based on three dynamic interaction primitives (DIPs) that are common to many sporting activities: catching, throwing, and striking. For each of these primitives, an original modeling approach is proposed. Furthermore, we introduce and formalize the concept of dynamic virtual fixtures (DVFs). These fixtures aim to assist the user in tasks involving interaction with moving objects or with objects to be set in movement. Two experiments have been carried out to investigate the influence of different DVFs on human performance in the context of ball catching and archery. The results reveal a significant positive effect of the DVFs, and that DVFs could be either classified as ""performance-assisted"" or ""learning-assisted."""

287	GameSE_abstract	Efficient choice enumeration for narrative world design	An open challenge for AI in digital games is narrative experience management, the problem of automatically directing virtual characters in an interactive story to produce specific narrative effects for human participants. One important aspect of interactive narrative quality is participant choice, which provides the central distinction between interactive and linear storytelling. Most experience management work identifies storytelling patterns an agent should value or guides participants through high-value story trajectories. However, the types and quality of choices available in an interactive story are influenced not only by a model of narrative and specific story character actions, but also the world design that affords situations and actions. In this paper, we present a method for generating all unique, accessible choice combinations for a story world as a first step towards experience-driven interactive narrative world design. We benchmark the approach against several baselines and discuss its use as a tool for human and automated world designers.

288	GameSE_abstract	Parallel evolutionary approaches for game playing and verification using Intel Xeon Phi	Automatic generation of artificial players is an important subject for the videogames industry. Different strategies have been proposed to implement realistic and intelligent agents for gameplaying and verification. This article presents a parallel evolutionary approach for the automation of computer player generation for video games. A learning pipeline model is defined to study the generation problem for Nintendo Entertainment System games composed of three stages: objective inference, objective refinement and artificial intelligence generation. Two case studies based on the defined pipeline are presented: an evolutionary algorithm to learn how to play the game Pinball, offloading the evaluation of the fitness function to a Xeon Phi coprocessor, and a full pipeline implementation that uses neuroevolution to generate RNNs that can play different games successfully. Results show that the proposed pipeline can be applied for the automatic generation of artificial players for the studied games.

289	GameSE_abstract	Developing an automated planning tool for non-player character behavior	Artificial intelligence is one of the fundamental pillars on which the video game development is settled. For this reason, there are tools used in the production of a video game specifically designed for the simulation of intelligence, in order to improve the behavior of nonplayer characters. However, only few companies have enough resources for dealing with innovation in the field of artificial intelligence. This causes that small companies or independent developers often have to rely on well-known techniques that are available by default in game engines or asset stores. Unfortunately, there is a lack of quality resources related to classic techniques of artificial intelligence. To solve this problem, we have develop a tool for Unreal Engine that allows automated planning for non-player characters in a simple way, using a Goal-Oriented Action Planning architecture. This tool has been developed as a code plugin, allowing it to be easily included in any project, and it has been published as a free asset, to make it more accessible to researchers and developers.

290	GameSE_abstract	Using program by demonstration and visual scripting to supporting game design	Creating the behavior for non-player characters (NPCs) in video games is a complex task that requires the collaboration among programmers and game designers. Usually these game designers are responsible of configuring and fine tuning certain parameters of the behavior, while programmers write the actual code of those behaviors. That requires several iterations between them.

291	GameSE_abstract	Combining neural networks for controlling non-player characters in games	Creating the behavior for non-player characters in video games is a complex task that requires the collaboration among programmers and game designers. Usually game designers are only allowed to change certain parameters of the behavior, while programmers write new code whenever the behavior intended by designers cannot be achieved by just parameter tweaking. This becomes a time-consuming process that requires several iterations of designers testing the solution provided by programmers, followed by additional changes in the requirements that programmers must again re-implement. In this paper, we present an approach for creating the behavior of non-player characters in video games that gives more power to the game designer by combining program by demonstration and behavior trees. Our approach is able to build some parts of a behavior tree with the observed data in a previous training phase.

292	GameSE_abstract	Trained behavior trees: Programming by demonstration to support AI game designers	--Programming by demonstration (PbD) has a straightforward application in the development of the artificial intelligence (AI) for nonplayer characters (NPCs) in a video game: a game designer controls the NPC during a training session in the game, and thus demonstrates the expected behavior for that character in different situations. Afterwards, applying some machine learning technique on the traces recorded during the demonstration, an AI for the NPC can be generated. Nevertheless, with this approach, it is very hard for the game designer to fully control the resulting behavior, which is a key requirement for game designers, who are responsible for putting together a fun experience for the player. In this paper, we present trained behavior trees (TBTs). TBTs are behavior trees (BTs) generated from traces obtained in a game through PbD. BTs are a technique widely used for AI game programming that are created and modified through special purpose visual editors. By inducing a BT from a PbD game session, we combine the ease of use of PbD with the ability to fine-tune the learned behavior of BTs. Furthermore, TBTs facilitate the use of BTs by game designers and promote their authoring control on game AI.

293	GameSE_abstract	A novel gesture driven fuzzy interface system for car racing game	The recently developed Kinect sensor has opened a new horizon to Human-Computer Interface (HCI) and its native connection with Microsoft's product line of Xbox 360 and Xbox One video game consoles makes completely hands-free control in next generation of gaming. Games that requires a lot of degree of freedoms, especially the driving control of a car in racing games is best suitable to be driven by gestures, as the use of simple buttons does not scale to the increased number of assistive, comfort, and infotainment functions. In this paper, we propose a Mamdani type-I fuzzy inference system based data processing module which effectively takes into account the dependence of actual steering angle with the distance of two palm positions and angle generated with respect to the sagittal plane. The FIS output variable controls the duration of a virtual 'key-pressed' event which mocks the users pressing of actual keys assigned to control car direction in the original game. The acceleration and brake(deceleration) of the vehicle is controlled using the relative displacement of left and right feet. The proposed experimental setup, interfacing Kinect and a desktop based racing game, has shown that the virtual driving environment can be easily applied to any games belonging to this particular genre.

To address these issues, an analysis of several available GDDs found in the literature was performed, contrasting our findings with the best practices from Software Requirements Specification (SRS). Our improved GDD incorporates a common understanding of terms, quality assurance, decision making, definition of relations, boundaries, limitations and knowledge of game elements.

295	GameSE_abstract	Accessibility evaluation of video games for users with cognitive disabilities	Currently, there are many students with cognitive problems to learn new concepts in theoretical classes. For students to improve the learning process from the knowledge transmitted in class, we propose a method to motivate the development of computer applications to reinforce the learning of new concepts. This research presents a method for evaluation of accessible video games. In order to evaluate accessibility in a videogame, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 will be considered, which includes barriers for users with cognitive disabilities. This category of users involves people with limited ability to process and memorize information, make decisions, or learn. The proposed method can be replicated for users with other types of disabilities and can be applied during the game development cycle to ensure a more inclusive and accessible product.

296	GameSE_abstract	A Hand Gesture Set for Navigating and Interacting with 3D Virtual Environments	Recent advances in consumer-level VR technologies have increased interest in using hand gestures to interact more intuitively with computers. Unfortunately, there are still few accepted norms for gestures that map to functions, and identifying suitable hand gestures for a given use case is difficult. In this paper we review research on how to define a good gesture set. Based on this we develop and evaluate a hand gesture set for controlling and navigating interactive virtual environments, such as games or simulations. A user study shows that the resulting gesture set is intuitive, easy to perform and remember, and overall likeable. The lowest scores were received for gestures for changing the users's location.	computer games; gesture recognition; hand gestures; interaction; navigation; virtual environment; virtual reality	Sampson, H.; Kelly, D.; Wunsche, B.C.; Amor, R.

297	GameSE_abstract	Playability: Analysing user experience in video games	Currently, few studies focus on analysing the degree of the Player eXperience (PX) in video games. Video games have now become interactive entertainment systems with a high economic impact on society; these are interactive systems characterised by their subjectivity, which differ from other systems in that their main objective is to entertain and amuse the user (player). This work discusses the analysis and evaluation of the User eXperience (UX) in interactive entertainment systems, exploring how usability, given its definition, objectives and the fact it is one of the main dimensions of UX, is not sufficient to characterise the PX, giving rise to a new concept: Playability. In this paper, we present a framework for the analysis and evaluation of the UX in video games. The results show the need and importance of a framework to help us understand and measure the experience that players feel using these types of interactive systems, in order to improve the experience during play time. The proposed framework characterises the experience using attributes to identify and properties to measure UX. It thus provides a multifaceted analysis mechanism to assess the impact of the gaming experience and its relationship with the elements of a video game. We therefore present a system to represent UX based on this framework, with the aim of ensuring and measuring a satisfactory experience of the entertainment system. Finally, we discuss a practical experiment in which an evaluation of the playability of a commercial video game was carried out using the methods proposed in this work.	interactive systems; playability; usability; user experience; video games	Sanchez, J.L.G.; Vela, F.L.G.; Simarro, F.M.; Padilla-Zea, N.

298	GameSE_abstract	A DSL for rapid prototyping of cross-platform tower defense games	Because of the increasing expansion of the videogame industry, shorten videogame time to market for diverse platforms (e.g, Mac, android, iOS, BlackBerry) is a quest. This paper presents how a Domain Specific Language (DSL) in conjunction with Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques can automate the development of games, in particular, tower defense games such as Plants vs. Zombies. The DSL allows the expression of structural and behavioral aspects of tower defense games. The MDE techniques allow us to generate code from the game expressed in the DSL. The generated code is written in an existing open source language that leverages the portability of the games. We present our approach using an example so-called Space Attack. The example shows the significant benefits offered by our proposal in terms of productivity and portability.

299	GameSE_abstract	LevelMerge: Collaborative Game Level Editing by Merging Labeled Graphs	Game development is commonly seen as a collaborative effort, with teams cooperating on the same project. Nowadays, a variety of cloud-based services have shown the benefits of performing tasks in real-time collaboration with others. In this article, we present a system for collaborative game level editing. We model this problem as a special instance of merging labeled directed acyclic graphs. We propose an algorithm that guarantees that the shared game level is always coherent between edits, both hierarchically and semantically. We establish real-time collaboration by initiating merges automatically and by augmenting the game editor interface to allow users to monitor all others edits in real time. We validate our algorithm by merging complex edits and large game levels. We further validate the collaborative workflow by running a user study with expert game developers, showing that our system works well and collaborative workflows are beneficial to game development.	collaborative content creation; computer graphics; game development; game level editing	Santoni, C.; Salvati, G.; Tibaldo, V.; Pellacini, F.

301	GameSE_abstract	The fundamental topics of static global illumination algorithms for 3D games	Global Illumination is a challenging topic in 3D game. Several algorithms have been developed using various approaches. The first algorithm is developed using geometrical approach. Nowadays, the development is shifted to texture based and physics based approach. In proposing the algorithm, the developer also has a different focus. Some of them are optimizing memory usage, some of them are improving visual appearance. To keep up with the development of Global Illumination, academician have to understand about state of the art and fundamental concept underlying Global Illumination. Based on the ambience that is handled, we could classify Global Illumination algorithm into two types. They are static global illumination that handle single ambience color and dynamic global illumination that handle complex indirect illumination with more than one ambience colors. In this paper, we summarize some algorithm in static global illumination. The aim of this paper is defining fundamental concept underlying static Global Illumination in order to minimizing gap between industries and academician.	3D rendering; Computer graphics; Game development; Static global illumination	Sar'Dyah, H.; Fathoni, K.; Basuki, D.K.; Basofi, A.	2018 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Communication and Information Systems, ICCIS 2018	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOMIS.2018.8644760		237-241		Included	Included	new_screen			2	Scopus	2019	The Fundamental Topics Of Static Global Illumination Algorithms For 3D Games	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063157891&doi=10.1109%2fICOMIS.2018.8644760&partnerID=40&md5=dd8b94fc15418f33901bd9481f056273	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc	nan; Venue; References; Year; Bibtex
302	GameSE_abstract	A generative programming approach for game development	Nowadays, due to the great distance between design and implementation worlds, different skills are necessary to create a game system. To solve this problem, a lot of strategies for game development, trying to increase the abstraction level necessary for the game production, were proposed. In this way, a lot of game engines, game frameworks and others, in most cases without any compatibility or reuse criteria between them, were developed. This paper presents a new generative programming approach, able to increase the production of a digital game by the integration of different game development artifacts, following a system family strategy focused on variable and common aspects of a computer game. As result, high level abstractions of games, based on a common language, can be used to configure metaprogramming transformations during the game production, providing a great compatibility level between game domain and game implementation artifacts.

They explored different types of games genres, categories and platforms, such as Short Messaging Service (SMS) competitions and text-based adventures on Instant Messaging (IM) bots. This paper presents IMgine, a game engine able to provide TM games across distinct IM platforms. It implements game engine routines in a configured game loop for multiple IM platforms, capable of representing TM game states and logic by the execution of predefined game functions. As validation process, IM games were developed to show the IMgine capability of providing game mechanics and dynamics aspects according to TM and IM restrictions. As a result, a foundation for IM games that organizes the definition of TM game states and logic is provided, allowing game developers to be concerned with the game core implementation instead of IM transmission process or TM interaction limits.

305	GameSE_abstract	Using rating arrays to estimate score distributions for player-versus-level matchmaking	Rating systems (like Elo and Glicko-2) have previously been used for predicting the expected score that a player will achieve on a level. We present an approach that predicts not a single score, but an approximate cumulative distribution function over possible scores. This approach assigns each level an array of multiple ratings for different score thresholds. Our long-term goal is twofold: first, to dynamically change level difficulty for each player by using this CDF to tailor the target score required to complete a level; second, in human computation games (HCGs), to identify players capable of setting new high scores that could correspond to improved solutions to underlying tasks. To move towards this goal, we explore the rating array approach using two datasets: one gathered from the HCG Paradox, and one generated from idealized players and levels. We examine the accuracy of the CDF and the expected scores it predicts, as well as its use in serving levels to players who could set new high scores.

306	GameSE_abstract	The human factors of consistency maintenance in multiplayer computer games	Consistency maintenance (CM) techniques are a crucial part of many distributed systems, and are particularly important in networked games. In this paper we describe a framework of the human factors of CM, to help designers of networked games make better decisions about its use. The framework shows that there is wide variance in the CM requirements of different game situations, identifies the types of requirements that can be considered, and analyses the effects of several consistency schemes on user experience factors. To further explore these issues, we carried out a simulation study that compared four CM algorithms. The experiment confirms many of the predictions of the framework, and reveals additional subtleties of the algorithms. Our work is the first to look comprehensively at the tradeoffs and costs of CM, and our results are a strong starting point that will help designers improve on the user's quality of experience in distributed shared environments.	consistency maintenance; game development; game usablity	Savery, C.; Graham, T.C.N.; Gutwin, C.

309	GameSE_abstract	Intelligent PC Games: Comparison of Neural Network Based AI against Pre-Scripted AI	Artificial Intelligence in PC games is a known concept and refers to designing the game such that even while playing games alone, there is a degree of intelligence in actions performed by the non-playable characters (NPCs) simulating human like behavior. It is often argued that video game AI is not truly intelligent and simply follows a set of instructions scripted by the developer. Hence, the objective is to study and compare traditional AI against a machine learned AI and make inferences based on the result. A game is developed in unity engine which is complex enough such that there is a balance of complexity in terms of difficulty to learn the game while also being simple enough to generate results as fast as possible.

310	GameSE_abstract	Designing with autonomous tools: Video games, procedural generation, and creativity	"Designers are increasingly using autonomous tools to perform complex activity more quickly and in different ways, often with little or no human intervention. These autonomous tools are changing the way many designers approach their work, and the creative outcomes of that work. On the one hand, autonomously generated designs might not provide the same creative user experience as manually designed content, because autonomous tools are fundamentally deterministic in nature. On the other hand, the potentially creative benefits of using autonomous tools relate to the potential variety-that may be perceived as unpredictability by the designers-of their output. We report on a study of three cases of video game development that use procedural generation of content and we theorize about how organizations manage for creative user experiences when using autonomous tools in videogame production. We find that they address the inherent tension between determinism and variety by using a set of modular design practices that help guide autonomous tools in ways that allow for open-endedness and creativity. We refer to these practices as ""architectural structuring"" and ""injecting variety"" and we propose that the ""level of modularity"" as well as the ""level of manual design"" are critical for creative outcomes. We generate propositions associated with the two practices."

311	GameSE_abstract	Behavior Trees for Computer Games	Although a Finite State Machine (FSM) is easy to implement the behaviors of None-Player Characters (NPC) in computer games, it is difficult to maintain and control the behaviors with increasing the number of states. Alternatively, Behavior Tree (BT), which is a tree of hierarchical nodes to control the ow of decision making, is widely used in computer games to address the scalability issues. This paper reviews the structure and semantics of BTs in computer games. Different techniques to automatically learn and build BTs as well as strengths and weaknesses of these techniques are discussed. This paper provides a taxonomy of BT features and shows to what extent these features are taken into account in computer games. Finally, the paper shows how BTs are used in practice in the gaming industry.	Behavior tree; computer games; decision making; non-player character	Sekhavat, Y.A.

312	GameSE_abstract	Towards model checking of computer games with Java PathFinder	We show that Java source code of computer games can be checked for bugs such as uncaught exceptions by the model checker Java PathFinder (JPF). To model check Java games, we need to tackle the state space explosion problem and handle native calls. To address those two challenges we use our extensions of JPF, jpf-probabilistic and jpf-nhandler. The former deals with the randomization in the source code of the game, which is a cause of the state space explosion problem. The latter handles native calls automatically. We show how JPF enhanced with our extensions can check games such as the text based game Hamurabi and a graphics based version of rock-paper-scissors.

313	GameSE_abstract	Implementation of a 2D A. I. Agent for nondeterministic games using Convolution Neural Network	Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) in video games is largely used in designing an agent, also known as Non-Playable Characters (NPCs), that mimics characteristics of a human player. Evidently, the field of A.I. agent-based game development is flourishing due to recent advancement in the field of deep learning. This study presents the role of different Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) employed in the development of A.I agent-based games and also proposes a model which is a variant of CNN. For the purpose of this study the game used is a basic jumping platformer game in which the game character, which is of the primary focus, is tasked with dodging obstacles by either jumping or ducking. The obstacles are generated randomly and include objects like cactuses and flying vultures. The model proposed, is a variant of CNN that fashions an AI agent that predicts the game character's movement, based on the current environment of the game, to mimic the performance of a human player. The performance of the model proposed results in an accuracy of 97.03 % on both the testing and training set.

314	GameSE_abstract	Automatic game AI design by the use of UCT for Dead-End	Video game AI aims at generating an intelligent game opponent which is to compete with player, so game AI design plays an important role in the development of game. Nowadays, most of the game AI is implemented by FSM. But this mechanism has some drawbacks, so we need a mechanism to design game AI automatically instead of FSM. The process of automatic game AI design by UCT is introduced in this paper. In this process, we only take the meta-rules into consideration, while those many complicated detail knowledge is acquired by simulation. Here we propose the approach of UCT-controlled NPC based on CI (computational intelligence). However, this approach will consume lots of computational resources, and the acquired knowledge cannot be stored. To solve this problem, we train Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to make it reusable. The whole design process is validated on the Test-Bed of the game Dead-End. We conclude that from both the simplification of implementation and the reusability, this process outperforms FSM.

315	GameSE_abstract	Using an agent-based approach for robust automated testing of computer games	Modern computer games typically have a huge interaction spaces and non-deterministic environments. Automation in testing can provide a vital boost in development and it further improves the overall software's reliability and efficiency. Moreover, layout and game logic may regularly change during development or consecutive releases which makes it difficult to test because the usage of the system continuously changes. To deal with the latter, tests also need to be robust. Unfortunately, existing game testing approaches are not capable of maintaining test robustness. To address these challenges, this paper presents an agent-based approach for robust automated testing based on the reasoning type of AI.	agent-based automated testing; automated testing of computer games; Robust automated testing	Shirzadehhajimahmood, S.; Prasetya, I.S.W.B.; Dignum, F.; Dastani, M.; Keller, G.

316	GameSE_abstract	A Comparative Analysis of Game Engines to Develop Core Assets for a Software Product Line of Mini-Games	The selection of a video game engine to develop core assets of a Software Product Line (SPL) of mini games could be highly influenced by the requisites of the SPL, differentiating it from the usual selection criteria applied when building complex video games. This article presents a comparative analysis between two video game engines, unity and P5. The purpose of this analysis was to select the most appropriate option to implement the SPL core assets. Taking into account the requirements of the products to be generated from the SPL, we found that the option initially proposed as the most appropriate did not meet the most relevant requirements of the SPL.

317	GameSE_abstract	Voxel based pathfinding with jumping for games	Pathfinding plays a vital role in video games, whether in terms of gameplay mechanics or player immersion. Commonly used methods only allow the simplest types of movements like walking and running. Although seldom, other types of movement like swimming and flying are also considered. Even rarer are mechanisms that natively contemplate jumps, without the need of extra intervention of game developers. Most games overlook these movements on Non Player Characters, affecting player experience. This article discusses the limitations of Navigation Meshes when it comes to take jumps into consideration and proposes a new solution using grid-based any-angle pathfinding. Each cell of this navigation grid constitutes a voxel that delimits a small 3D space and is expressed in a shape of a cube. Voxels discretize the game world and are explored by a search algorithm to achieve pathfinding with jumps. Performance is critical and found paths should be optimal and efficient. Results show that the proposed solution can be successfully applied in game development.	Jumping AI; Path planning on grids; Pathfinding; Voxel based worlds	Silva, G.; Reis, G.; Grilo, C.

The use of Dynamic Difficulty Balancing in modern computer games is useful when looking to improve the entertainment value of a game. Moreover, the Symbiotic Game Agent, as a framework, provides flexibility and robustness as a design principle for game agents. The work presented here leverages both the advantages of Adaptive Game AI and Symbiotic Game Agents to implement a robust, efficient and testable model for game difficulty scaling. The model is discussed in detail and is compared to the original Symbiotic Game Agent architecture. Finally, the paper describes how it was applied in simulated soccer.

320	GameSE_abstract	VGPM: Using business process modeling for videogame modeling and code generation in multiple platforms	Lately, the use of mobile applications in Smartphones has grown considerably. One of the most popular types of applications is videogames. As classic videogame development is a costly process several editors and tools to make this process quicker and easier have appeared. Although these editors allow the definition of various aspects of the videogame they do not include, in general, capabilities for modeling the logic of the game loop. In this research we propose VGPM, a specific notation based in the BPMN approach to define several important characteristics of the game logic, trying to reduce the cost of traditional videogame development.

321	GameSE_abstract	Path planning directed motion control of virtual humans in complex environments	Natural motion synthesis of virtual humans have been studied extensively, however, motion control of virtual characters actively responding to complex dynamic environments is still a challenging task in computer animation. It is a labor and cost intensive animator-driven work to create realistic human motions of character animations in a dynamically varying environment in movies, television and video games. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a novel approach of motion synthesis that applies the optimal path planning to direct motion synthesis for generating realistic character motions in response to complex dynamic environment. In our framework, SIPP (Safe Interval Path Planning) search is implemented to plan a globally optimal path in complex dynamic environments. Three types of control anchors to motion synthesis are for the first time defined and extracted on the obtained planning path, including turning anchors, height anchors and time anchors. Directed by these control anchors, highly interactive motions of virtual character are synthesized by motion field which produces a wide variety of natural motions and has high control agility to handle complex dynamic environments. Experimental results have proven that our framework is capable of synthesizing motions of virtual humans naturally adapted to the complex dynamic environments which guarantee both the optimal path and the realistic motion simultaneously.

323	GameSE_abstract	Design and evaluation of RaPIDO, A platform for rapid prototyping of interactive outdoor games	Outdoor, multi-player games involving social interaction and physical activity are an emerging class of applications particularly interesting for children, for whom the attraction and the health and developmental benefits are clear cut. Implementing and prototyping such games present non-trivial technical challenges to interaction and game designers; this hampers iterative prototyping and testing cycles that are core to usercentred design and game development processes. This insight has motivated the development of RaPIDO (Rapid prototyping of Physical Interaction Design for Outdoor games), a prototyping platform for physical computing, targeting interaction designers with limited electronics or software skills. RaPIDO has been evaluated in a user test, evaluating RaPIDOs software library, and in a case study involving two designers who used it to develop outdoor games for children. We illustrate how RaPIDO enabled broader exploration of the design space and faster iterations than would otherwise be possible, allowing designers to focus on the core game concepts rather than complex and low-level engineering issues.

In this paper we lay out a challenging research agenda built on these ideas. We discuss several research ideas for novel language fea- tures to support atomic actions and reactive programming. We also explore challenges for main memory query pro- cessing in games and simulations including adaptive query plan selection, support for multi-core and parallel archi- tectures, debugging simulation scripts, and extensions for multi-player games and virtual worlds. We believe that these research challenges will result in a dramatic change in the design of game engines over the next decade.

Anti-cheat software is, however, always a step behind the opposition and as such new and innovative solutions are required. This paper considers AI driven tools as one such approach and compared decision trees, SVMs and Naive Bayes classifiers in an attempt to classify cheating and honest player behaviour. The results of the research highlighted the potential for mouse dynamics as a measure of player behaviour, and decision trees as the most accurate detector of honest player behaviour.

326	GameSE_abstract	Artificial playfulness: A tool for automated agent-based playtesting	Usertesting is commonly employed in games user research (GUR) to understand the experience of players interacting with digital games. However, recruitment and testing with human users can be laborious and resource-intensive, particularly for independent developers. To help mitigate these obstacles, we are developing a framework for simulated testing sessions with agents driven by artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, we aim to imitate the navigation of human players in a virtual world. By mimicking the tendency of users to wander, explore, become lost, and so on, these agents may be used to identify basic issues with a game's world and level design, enabling informed iteration earlier in the development process. Here, we detail our progress in developing a framework for configurable agent navigation and simple visualization of simulated data. Ultimately, we hope to provide a basis for the development of a tool for simulation-driven usability testing in games.

327	GameSE_abstract	Evaluating real-time strategy game states using convolutional neural networks	Real-time strategy (RTS) games, such as Blizzard's StarCraft, are fast paced war simulation games in which players have to manage economies, control many dozens of units, and deal with uncertainty about opposing unit locations in real-time. Even in perfect information settings, constructing strong AI systems has been difficult due to enormous state and action spaces and the lack of good state evaluation functions and high-level action abstractions. To this day, good human players are still handily defeating the best RTS game AI systems, but this may change in the near future given the recent success of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer Go, which demonstrated how networks can be used for evaluating complex game states accurately and to focus look-ahead search. In this paper we present a CNN for RTS game state evaluation that goes beyond commonly used material based evaluations by also taking spatial relations between units into account. We evaluate the CNN's performance by comparing it with various other evaluation functions by means of tournaments played by several state-of-the-art search algorithms. We find that, despite its much slower evaluation speed, on average the CNN based search performs significantly better compared to simpler but faster evaluations. These promising initial results together with recent advances in hierarchical search suggest that dominating human players in RTS games may not be far off.

329	GameSE_abstract	GameFlow heuristics for designing and evaluating real-time strategy games	The GameFlow model strives to be a general model of player enjoyment, applicable to all game genres and platforms. Derived from a general set of heuristics for creating enjoyable player experiences, the GameFlow model has been widely used in evaluating many types of games, as well as non-game applications. However, we recognize that more specific, low-level, and implementable criteria are potentially more useful for designing and evaluating video games. Consequently, the research reported in this paper aims to provide detailed heuristics for designing and evaluating one specific game genre, real-time strategy games. In order to develop these heuristics, we conducted a grounded theoretical analysis on a set of professional game reviews and structured the resulting heuristics using the GameFlow model. The resulting 165 heuristics for designing and evaluating real-time strategy games are presented and discussed in this paper.	enjoyment; evaluation; flow; game design; games; heuristics; model	Sweetser, P.; Johnson, D.; Ozdowska, A.; Wyeth, P.

330	GameSE_abstract	GameFlow 2020: 15 Years of a Model of Player Enjoyment	The original GameFlow model was first published in 2005 and in the last 15 years it has seen thousands of citations and hundreds of applications to designing and evaluating games and gameful experiences. Previous work has sought to test and validate the model by applying it to different game experiences to further understand those experiences and to expose any weaknesses of the model. In this paper, we survey over 200 applications of GameFlow over the last 15 years, to understand how, where, and why the model has been applied. We found that the model has been applied to a diverse set of experiences, domains, platforms, audiences, and used in a variety of ways. This work lays the foundations for targeting the next version of the GameFlow model towards the most valuable and appropriate applications and to define how it fits within the broader landscape of player experience tools.	design; enjoyment; evaluation; GameFlow; heuristics; player experience; video games	Sweetser, P.

331	GameSE_abstract	3D Optical Reconstruction of Building Interiors for Game Development	This paper presents current possibilities of using stereophotogrammetry to scan interiors for video games. This technology offers great possibilities for effective room scanning based on popular cameras, however, it also has some limitations in the implementation of a fully automatic image processing. As the result of the STERIO project, the Sterio Reconstruction tool has been created that offers semi-automatic 3D reconstruction of building interiors. The proposed technology can be used, among others, for modeling rooms for video games which action takes place in locations reflecting real interiors. The original, large-scale experiment has been carried out in order to validate the created technology in real conditions. The goal of the experiment was to develop a prototype 3D video game by a small development studio using created solutions. The experiment showed great possibilities of the developed tool and the technology used.	3D scanning; Image processing; Interiors reconstruction; Stereo-photogrammetry; Video games	Szwoch, M.; Bartoszewski, D.

332	GameSE_abstract	RUIS - A toolkit for developing virtual reality applications with spatial interaction	We introduce Reality-based User Interface System (RUIS), a virtual reality (VR) toolkit aimed for students and hobbyists, which we have used in an annually organized VR course for the past four years. RUIS toolkit provides 3D user interface building blocks for creating immersive VR applications with spatial interaction and stereo 3D graphics, while supporting affordable VR peripherals like Kinect, PlayStation Move, Razer Hydra, and Oculus Rift. We describe a novel spatial interaction scheme that combines freeform, full-body interaction with traditional video game locomotion, which can be easily implemented with RUIS. We also discuss the specific challenges associated with developing VR applications, and how they relate to the design principles behind RUIS. Finally, we validate our toolkit by comparing development difficulties experienced by users of different software toolkits, and by presenting several VR applications created with RUIS, demonstrating a variety of spatial user interfaces that it can produce.	3D user interface; Software toolkit; Unity	Takala, T.M.

333	GameSE_abstract	Research on artificial intelligence algorithm and its application in games	With the in-depth development of intelligent technology, game artificial intelligence (AI) has become the technical core of improving the playability of a game and the main selling point of game promotion, deepening the game experience realm. Modern computer games achieve the realism of games by integrating graphics, physics and artificial intelligence. It is difficult to define the meaning of realistic game experience, but generally speaking, it usually refers to the immersion of the game and the intelligence of non-player characters in the game. As the technical core of improving game playability and the selling point of many commercial games, game artificial intelligence gives players a way to interact with non-player characters in the game, and promotes the realm of game experience to a higher level. Based on this, this paper analyzes the history and present situation of artificial intelligence in game development, and puts forward the possible changes and impacts of artificial intelligence technology based on machine learning on game development in the future.

335	GameSE_abstract	Models as bridges from design thinking to engineering	In this paper we address the critical link between design thinking (DT) and software engineering by investigating the role of models as artifacts crossing the boundaries from designers to other disciplines like engineering. We introduce our approach (mDT, multidisciplinary Design Thinking) by describing its methods. We show how the results of a DT process can be handed over to others. We focus on the characteristics of the artifacts DT induce. We suggest using design models (i.e., use, systems and interaction models) to create a smooth transition from design to engineering and other disciplines. We illustrate our mDT by giving some examples from a previous DT project before concluding the paper.	Design Thinking; Innovation.; Models; User-Centered Design	Tellioglu, H.

336	GameSE_abstract	Opponent-based tactic selection for a first person shooter game	Video games are quickly becoming a significant part of society with a growing industry that employs a wide range of talent, from programmers to graphic artists. Video games are also becoming an interesting and useful testbed for Artificial Intelligence research. Complex, realistic environmental constraints, as well as performance considerations demand highly efficient AI techniques. At the same time, the AI component of a video game may define the ongoing commercial success, or failure, of a particular game or game engine. This research details an approach to opponent modeling in a first person shooter game, and evaluates proficiency gains facilitated by such a technique. Information about the user is recorded and used by the existing Artificial Intelligence component to select tactics for any given opponent. The evaluation results show that when computer characters use such modeling they are more effective than when they do not model their opponent.

338	GameSE_abstract	Why is unit-testing in computer games difficult?	In this paper, we investigate how unit testing can be used to verify computer game simulations with implicit and poorly defined mathematical models. The difficulty of calculation of expected values for such cases tends to lead to Fragile and Obscure tests. The effects of these test smells can be reduced if we improve the strategy we use to calculate expected values. We investigate four strategies and while each of these is insufficient, we outline how they can be combined into a single, sufficient strategy.

This methodology has four stages that are: preproduction, production, testing and postproduction that were advantageous to finish the project on time. To achieve this, we have designed and developed an action platform game following the previously mentioned stages. In conclusion, we achieve to prove the applicability of the four stages methodology since we made a high quality game in a short period of time, using limited resources.

340	GameSE_abstract	Making maps available for play: Analyzing the design of game cartography interfaces	Maps in video games have grown into complex interactive systems alongside video games themselves. What map systems have done and currently do have not been cataloged or evaluated. We trace the history of game map interfaces from their paper-based inspiration to their current smart phone-like appearance. Readonly map interfaces enable players to consume maps, which is sufficient for wayfinding. Game cartography interfaces enable players to persistentlymodifymaps, expanding the range of activity to support planning and coordination. We employ thematic analysis on game cartography interfaces, contributing a near-exhaustive catalog of games featuring such interfaces, a set of properties to describe and design such interfaces, a collection of play activities that relate to cartography, and a framework to identify what properties promote the activities. We expect that designers will find the contributions enable them to promote desired play experiences through game map interface design.

341	GameSE_abstract	Simulating complex social behaviours of virtual agents through case-based planning	In commercial video games and simulations, non-player characters are capable of quite complex behaviour. Very often though, each class of non-player characters (that we further call virtual agents) is manually programmed or scripted. This means that instead of possessing some level of intelligence, allowing the agent to decide dynamically on the actions it needs to perform, we supply the agent with a list of possible situations that may arise in the game. For each such situation, we give the agent a pre-programmed script that tells it how to behave. Producing such scripts for every role an agent might play in a game or simulation is a very costly exercise. This may be acceptable in commercial game development, where budgets for modern games are sometimes comparable to budgets of Hollywood movies, but not adequate for research simulations and indie games. In this paper, we discuss how indie games and research simulations can be enriched with the sophisticated social behaviour of virtual agents in a semi-automatic manner through the use of AI planning. By supplying agents with roles and developing a computational model of their needs, we can use AI planning (also known as dynamic planning) to increase the complexity of agent behaviour dramatically and at the same time achieve a high degree of automation and reduce the development costs. AI planning is gaining popularity in games development, but it is often discarded due to performance issues. We will show how to improve the performance of planning process through the use of dynamic institutions and case-based planning. We will illustrate the aforementioned ideas on an example of developing a Virtual Reality simulation of everyday life in Ancient Mesopotamia.

342	GameSE_abstract	Tangible audio game development kit: Prototyping audio games with a tangible editor	Audio games are a genre of computer games that waive visual output and solely rely on audio. The majority of audio games (as well as video games) lack publicly available editors that allow the creation of new games or maps within the framework of the respective game. Additionally, no existing game or map editors make use of tangible interaction to facilitate embodied interaction during the creation of games. However, many elements in audio games can be mapped in a profitable way to a tangible editor. We therefore propose the Tangible Audio Game Development Kit that allows fast, iterative and collaborative audio game prototyping by combining physical objects. In this paper, we introduce a first prototype of this concept and present a user study featuring three game design experts. We discuss the results and explain the next steps in advancing the audio game editor based on the feedback.

343	GameSE_abstract	Extending Use Cases to Support Activity Design in Pervasive Mobile Games	Computer games are creative projects that require the input of professionals with very diverse backgrounds, including game designers, artists, and software developers. Game development frequently is a complex process due to different expectations of the involved stakeholders. With pervasive games, this situation becomes more chaotic as there are not specific processes devoted to the design and development of this type of game. In this paper, we propose atemplate-based language to design activities in pervasive mobile games in the conceptual design phase, helping to fill a gap between the preproduction and production stages of this type of game. We define a template for activity specification based on an extension of traditional use case templates. This extension helps in fulfilling a set of general goals that the activity modeling should address. We also present examples of using the proposed modeling approach in a real game.	activity design; game development; pervasive mobile games	Valente, L.; Feijo, B.

344	GameSE_abstract	Evolving dungeon crawler levels with relative placement	Procedural Content Generation (PCG) is the process of automating the construction of media types for use in game development, the movie industry, and other creative fields. By approaching the process of media creation as a search for content which is evaluated to express desirable features in a well-defined manner, we are able to apply evolutionary techniques such as genetic programming. This can greatly decrease the effort required to bring a project to completion by allowing artists and developers to focus on guiding the creation process. The specific generation process addressed is that of map creation for dungeon crawler video games. The search method proposed allows artists and developers to guide the generation process by specifying a set of tiles that define the composition of each map, and a fitness function that defines its structure.	evolutionary computation; level generation; procedural content generation	Valtchanov, V.; Brown, J.A.

345	GameSE_abstract	Generative approach for extending computer role-playing games at run-time	In modern-day computer role-playing games, virtual worlds contain numerous non-player characters and objects like weapons, armors and other items. The sheer number of items makes programming credible virtual worlds a time consuming task for application developers. This task can be eased using code generation tools to produce parts of game world automatically. In this paper, we introduce a generator to produce parts of game world for computer role-playing games. The application developer specifies a model and game world parts are generated from this model. The produced game world parts are represented as script code, and therefore it can be generated at run-time. Scripts can contain game weapons, places, non-player characters, almost anything that can be represented as a combination of numerical data. We demonstrate the use of our generator by generating scripts containing weapons, items and enemies for our western computer role playing game scenario.

346	GameSE_abstract	Measuring quality of grammars for procedural level generation	Grammar-based procedural level generation raises the productivity of level designers for games such as dungeon crawl and platform games. However, the improved productivity comes at cost of level quality assurance. Authoring, improving and maintaining grammars is difficult because it is hard to predict how each grammar rule impacts the overall level quality, and tool support is lacking. We propose a novel metric called Metric of Added Detail (MAD) that indicates if a rule adds or removes detail with respect to its phase in the transformation pipeline, and Specification Analysis Reporting (SAnR) for expressing level properties and analyzing how qualities evolve in level generation histories. We demonstrate MAD and SAnR using a prototype of a level generator called Ludoscope Lite. Our preliminary results show that problematic rules tend to break SAnR properties and that MAD intuitively raises flags. MAD and SAnR augment existing approaches, and can ultimately help designers make better levels and level generators.

348	GameSE_abstract	MDA game design for video game development by genre	Game's development process remains a difficult task due to game platform's increasing technological complexity and lack of game's development methodologies for unified processes. In this work we show a way to develop different types of arcade games genre using Model Driven Architecture (MDA). We present a metamodel for game design that allows the specification for a high level abstraction independently of platform. This proposal shows that it is possible to generate a 2D game from the essential characteristics that make up such type of video game. Also, some model transformation rules to generate executable Java code from a specific model are shown.

349	GameSE_abstract	Automated bug finding in video games: A case study for runtime monitoring	Runtime verification is the process of observing a sequence of events generated by a running system and comparing it to some formal specification for potential violations. We show how the use of a runtime monitor can greatly speed up the testing phase of a video game under development, by automating the detection of bugs when the game is being played. We take advantage of the fact that a video game, contrarily to generic software, follows a special structure that contains a 'game loop', this game loop can be used to centralize the instrumentation and generate events based on the game's internal state. We report on experiments made on a sample of five real-world video games of various genres and sizes, by successfully incrementing and efficiently monitoring various temporal properties over their execution-including actual bugs reported in the games' bug tracking database in the course of their development.	runtime verification; temporal logic; video games	Varvaressos, S.; Lavoie, K.; Masse, A.B.; Gaboury, S.; Halle, S.

350	GameSE_abstract	A Systematic Review on Software Engineering in Pervasive Games Development	A digital pervasive game can be defined as a game in which the gaming experience is extended to the real world. This is possible due to the use of sensor-based mobile devices. Developing digital pervasive games involves additional requirements, such as dealing with ubiquitous computing challenges. Part of these requirements affect directly the design and development processes of pervasive games. Software Engineering techniques should be adapted to increase the overall quality of game software. The main objective of this paper is to present a systematic review of this area in order to capture the state of the art research in Software Engineering for Pervasive Games. A standard systematic review methodology using digital databases for research was applied and 100 relevant studies were found within 1304 obtained from searches. We were able to identify the main topics of pervasive games research area in the last five years, the most relevant research methodologies, topics and challenges in terms of numbers for pervasive games research field.

351	GameSE_abstract	A Survey of Procedural Dungeon Generation	Procedural content generation (PCG) is a method of content creation fully or semi-performed by computers. PCG is widely used in game development to generate game content, from Rogue (1998) to No Man's Sky (2016). PCG generates final contents, which are ready to be added to a game, or intermediate contents, which are might work as content sketch to be polished by human designers. In this paper we survey the current state of procedural dungeon generation (PDG) research, a subarea of PCG. We analyzed the works according to the game features they generate, the solution strategy employed and the taxonomy of procedural content generation. Some of the relevant findings of the survey are: (1) PDG for 3D levels has been little explored; (2) few works supported levels with barriers, a game mechanic which blocks, temporarily, the player progression, and; (3) and just a few solutions relied on mixed-initiative approach, where a human design content is combined with a computer generated level.	game content generation; procedural content generation; procedural dungeon generation; survey	Viana, B.M.F.; Dos Santos, S.R.

353	GameSE_abstract	Evolving fuzzy logic rule-based game player model for game development	We propose a framework for automatic game parameter tuning using a game player model. Two kinds of computational intelligence techniques are used to create the framework: a fuzzy logic system (FS) as the decision maker and evolutionary computation as the model parameter optimizer. Insights from a game developer are integrated into the player model consisting of FS rules. FS membership function parameters are optimized by a differential evolution (DE) algorithm to find optimal model parameters. We conducted experiments in which our player model plays a turn-based strategy video game. DE optimization was able to evolve our player model such that it could compete well at various levels of game difficulty.

355	GameSE_abstract	How real is reality? A perceptually motivated system for quantifying visual realism in digital images	Contemporary video games are generally designed with the aim of engendering a state of immersion in their players. A sense of 'presence' is considered to be a prerequisite of total immersion, the ultimate level of immersion, and can be directly related to the degree of realism in the simulation presented in a videogame. However, continuously increasing the degree of visual realism in an image could cause adverse effects such as fault amplification and more importantly, emotions like fear and dread of the uncanny. It can also substantially raise the development costs of a game. Consequently, videogame developers would benefit greatly from knowing the threshold beyond which increased realism is counter-productive. This paper details the development of an image processing system that measures the degree of realism of an image using three methods - gradient variance, color variance and shadow softness - derived from existing theories and practices in perceptual psychology, photoforensics and image processing. It then discusses testing of the system on a variety of photographic and video game images.

356	GameSE_abstract	Classification of Humans and Bots in Two Typical Two-player Computer Games	The aim of this paper is to explore whether or not the artificial intelligence (AI) embedded in traditional and typical computer games can be easily identified by players. We pay particular attention on AI simulation in simple games. Therefore, a 2D shooting game and a car racing game are developed by using different game AIs (game bots). Meanwhile, a Turing Test for computer game bots is implemented to test the abilities of above two computer games playing agents (bots) to simulate human game playing behavior. For the 2D shooting game three types of game AIs, random moving, finite state machine (FSM) and neural networks (NN), are used as agents to test. The results demonstrate that more humanized AI shows better human game playing behavior then others. For the race game a waypoints AI are developed. The experimental results show that although the paths design have a variety of changes, only 15% players be cheated. Careful review of the player's controls shows that players are more often fine-tune the location of the car to center it in the track. The research results can be seen as the based line of simple game AI development.	2D shooting game; game AI; neural networks; racing game; waypoints	Wang, J.-Y.	2018 3rd International Conference on Computer and Communication Systems, ICCCS 2018	https://doi.org/10.1109/CCOMS.2018.8463277		282-290		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen		AI: Studies that were focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI).	2	Scopus	2018	Classification Of Humans And Bots In Two Typical Two-Player Computer Games	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054799964&doi=10.1109%2fCCOMS.2018.8463277&partnerID=40&md5=da41f0720e7a14d442c23aaad71f653f	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc	nan; Venue; References; Year; Bibtex

358	GameSE_abstract	Modeling player retention in Madden NFL 11	Video games are increasingly producing huge datasets available for analysis resulting from players engaging in interactive environments. These datasets enable investigation of individual player behavior at a massive scale, which can lead to reduced production costs and improved player retention. We present an approach for modeling player retention in Madden NFL 11, a commercial football game. Our approach encodes gameplay patterns of specific players as feature vectors and models player retention as a regression problem. By building an accurate model of player retention, we are able to identify which gameplay elements are most influential in maintaining active players. The outcome of our tool is recommendations which will be used to influence the design of future titles in the Madden NFL series.

Based on a literature survey and professional practice, this work covers several examples of VR games, which were intended as such from the beginning (Job Simulator and Lucky's Tale) and others, which were ported to VR after their initial release (DOOM VR and LizzE). We conclude that, for VR games, it is essential to be optimized for the full potential of targeted interface technologies. Furthermore, porting former-non-VR games to VR can create successful user experiences, when aiming for the same high standard of optimization, especially regarding simulator sickness."

360	GameSE_abstract	Visual authoring tool for creating visual novel games	The paper proposes a visual authoring tool for a developing Visual Novel games. Visual Novels are games that work like reading a novel. Visual Novels are very popular in Japan, where they make up nearly 70% of PC games released. However, due to its heavy contents of erotic things and sex scenes, this type of games are less acceptable in other regions. Despite its popularity, not many tools or engines are available to help visual novel creators to easily develop these games. The implemented prototype is developed using Java Swing. Basically, the program has two main components, the visual authoring interface and the compiler. The visual interface lets the users to specify the flow of the story and compose words, pictures, as well as sounds to tell stories. Having finished the composition, the users can compile it to a Java class simply by pressing a button, that can then run independently outside the authoring tool itself. Unlike other Visual Novels authoring tools that require users to write a script to specify the novels, the proposed tool provides a graphical interface to compose the novels. This visual approach frees the users from learning the scripting which normally is a an obstacle for non-technical users. It also facilitates the settings of users' involvement level in the composed novel that allows the creator of this novels to adjust how much engagement of the users is expected in the finished novels. A simple test on the users shows that this visual authoring interface can help non-technical users to develop a visual novel relatively easily. Moreover, since it uses Java Swing , the tool is ensured to work crossplatform.	Authoring tool; Game development; Java swing; Visual novel	Wijaya, K.; Budiono, T.A.

361	GameSE_abstract	Identifying desirable game character behaviours through the application of evolutionary algorithms to model-driven engineering metamodels	This paper describes a novel approach to the derivation of model-driven engineering (MDE) models using metaheuristic search, and illustrates it using a specific engineering problem: that of deriving computer game characters with desirable properties. The character behaviour is defined using a human-readable domain-specific language (DSL) that is interpreted using MDE techniques. We apply the search to the underlying MDE metamodels, rather than the DSL directly, and as a result our approach is applicable to a wide range of MDE models. An implementation developed using the Eclipse Modeling Framework, the most widely-used toolset for MDE, is evaluated. The results demonstrate not only the derivation of characters with the desired properties, but also the identification of unexpected features of the behavioural description language and the game itself.

362	GameSE_abstract	An alternative natural action interface for virtual reality	The development of affordable virtual reality (VR) hardware represents a keystone of progress in modern software development and human-computer interaction. Despite the ready availability of robust hardware tools, there is presently a lack of video games or software in VR that demonstrates the gamut of unique and novel interfaces a virtual environment can provide. In this paper, we present a virtual reality video game which introduces unique user interface elements that can only be achieved in a 3D virtual environment. The video game, titled Wolf Hunt, provides users with a menu system that innovates on traditional interfaces with a virtual representation of a common item people interact with daily: a mobile phone. Wolf Hunt throws users into a procedurally generated world where they take the role of an individual escaping a wolf assailant. Deviating from traditional locomotion options in VR interfaces, such as teleportation, Wolf Hunt measures the displacement of hand-held VR controllers with the VR headset to simulate the natural action of running. Wolf Hunt provides an alternate interfacing solution for VR systems without having to conform to common 2D interface design schemes.

363	GameSE_abstract	Procedural generation using quantum computation	Quantum computation is an emerging technology that promises to be a powerful tool in many areas. Though some years likely still remain until significant quantum advantage is demonstrated, the development of the technology has led to a range of valuable resources. These include publicly available prototype quantum hardware, advanced simulators for small quantum programs and programming frameworks to test and develop quantum software. In this provocation paper we seek to demonstrate that these resources are sufficient to provide the first useful results in the field of procedural generation. This is done by introducing a proof-of-principle method: a quantum generalization of a blurring process, in which quantum interference is used to provide a unique effect. Through this we hope to show that further developments in the technology are not required before it becomes useful for procedural generation. Rather, fruitful experimentation with this new technology can begin now.	procedural generation; quantum computing	Wootton, J.R.

364	GameSE_abstract	A gesture design toolkit for computer games	Recently, vision based hand gesture interfaces have become very common. However, the development of such applications is very difficult. It requires sophisticated image processing and machine learning knowledge that is out of reach for many traditional game developers. They need an auxiliary tool to design vision based interfaces. This paper describes the motivation, design and development of a toolkit for vision based interactive games.

365	GameSE_abstract	Regression Testing of Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games	Regression testing aims to check the functionality consistency during software evolution. Although general regression testing has been extensively studied, regression testing in the context of video games, especially Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), is largely untouched so far. One big challenge is that game testing requires a certain level of intelligence in generating suitable action sequences among the huge search space, to accomplish complex tasks in the MMORPG. Existing game testing mainly relies on either the manual playing or manual scripting, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Even worse, it is often unable to satisfy the frequent industrial game evolution. The recent process in machine learning brings new opportunities for automatic game playing and testing. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based regression testing technique that explores differential behaviors between multiple versions of an MMORPGs such that the potential regression bugs could be detected. The preliminary evaluation on real industrial MMORPGs demonstrates the promising of our technique.	Game Testing, Reinforcement Learning	Wu, Y.; Chen, Y.; Xie, X.; Yu, B.; Fan, C.; Ma, L.

366	GameSE_abstract	Software ecosystems and digital games: Understanding the financial sustainability aspect	The digital games industry has a deep alignment with the field of Software Ecosystems (SECO). Despite the strict relationship, actors of the games industry do not apply the SECO perspective to understand the dynamics of the environment. Financial sustainability is considered a key factor for the permanence of these actors on the platforms and directly impacts the sustainability of an ecosystem. This paper presents a qualitative analysis in that challenging aspect of the digital game industry based on SECO concepts. A survey research that identified the benefits, problems and challenges aspects reported by games actors of digital games SECO in Brazil bases the statements and the analysis of this study. The focus was on exploring the reports of financial sustainability through the SECO perspective in order to help actors to understand the technical, business and social elements of this global and interconnected industry in the area of Information Systems. Finally, some ideas for academic research are listed, such as the need to use knowledge management to support studies on the business dimension of digital games SECO and the need to explore further relationships among games industry actors in the Brazilian context.

Starting from models and definitions that describe them, we present models that show game elements: components, players, environment, and their relations; as information systems elements. This paper also presents the analysis of five games and their elements based on that premise. As a ratification of our rationale, we present tools and visions shared by both fields. The presented premise and rationale could be easily linked to video games but, moreover, they are valid to all forms of games like tabletop games or sports.

368	GameSE_abstract	Lineup Mining and Balance Analysis of Auto Battler	Auto battler is currently one of the most popular types of video games on the market. In such type of games, players set up their own lineup of characters which combat automatically with other competitors. There are numerous kinds of chess pieces, lineups and bonuses in the game, which make the balance problem of game design extremely critical and challenging. In this paper, we use Chess Rush to investigate the methodology of evaluating the strength standards of lineups in auto battler games, and build a system for implementing such measurement. A neural network model is firstly trained for quick strength evaluation of the lineup. The genetic algorithm is then adopted and modified for the purpose of lineup mining of auto battler. Finally, strong lineups can be obtained under certain constraints. In this way, game developers can complete a balanced analysis before the game goes online. Moreover, the proposed approach can be generalized to balance analysis tasks of other games.

369	GameSE_abstract	DEv-PROMELA: modeling, verification, and validation of a video game by combining model-checking and simulation	Modeling, verifying, and validating are essential steps in order to build systems and software that do what designers expect. If formal verification, and especially model-checking, is a popular method for proving the correctness of properties, its efficiency depends on the accuracy of the used models and the quality of abstractions. As a consequence, applying verification techniques on large-scale complex software like video games is hard without strong assumptions and simplifications. Simulation models are generally more accurate than verification models, but it is often harder to verify them. Combined formalisms that take the benefits of both model-checking and discrete-event simulation represent a good deal between both of these families, although strong engineering expertise remains necessary to define the relevant tests and scenarios. This paper proposes an approach to build this kind of formalism through the example of DEv-PROMELA, which is built by combining Discrete-event System Specification formalism and PROMELA language. Then, it shows how combined formalisms can be used for modeling, verifying, and validating complex software like video games by using both formal-based and simulation-based verification and validation.

The personalization of experience via the modeling of the user, coupled with the appropriate adjustment of the content according to user needs and preferences are important steps towards effective and meaningful content generation. This paper introduces a framework for procedural content generation driven by computational models of user experience we name Experience-Driven Procedural Content Generation. While the framework is generic and applicable to various subareas of human computer interaction, we employ games as an indicative example of content-intensive software that enables rich forms of interaction.	affective loop; games; procedural content generation; user experience	Yannakakis, G.N.; Togelius, J.	2015 International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction, ACII 2015	https://doi.org/10.1109/ACII.2015.7344619		519-525		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen		Content Creation: Studies that were focused on Content Creation.	2	Scopus	2015	Experience-Driven Procedural Content Generation (Extended Abstract)	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964057208&doi=10.1109%2fACII.2015.7344619&partnerID=40&md5=b506f2b07a456050348a8bed3e739ab2	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc	nan; Venue; References; Year; Bibtex
373	GameSE_abstract	PokerFace: Game players themselves are truly memorable	Video games support instant replays so that game players can see previously occurred events (e.g., goals in sports games) again from a different point of view and permanently store such exciting moments and feelings as pleasant memories. However, players are likely to have different feelings and enjoyment depending on the player context, such as who they play with, their looks, or conversation during gaming even for the same game. Therefore, instant replays without such player context are not enough for users to remind the enjoyable moments that could not happen again, and thus precious memories will be forgotten. This paper presents PokerFace, a new video game console that provides advanced instant replays containing the player context. PokerFace detects memorable situations during gaming and generates advanced instant replays by combining both the game replay and the user's reaction and synchronizes them in time so that the players can see both their own looks and those of other players at the time when the exciting moment take place. Our system provides game players with better memories by storing advanced instant replays into the permanent storage or web blogs. We have implemented a prototype of PokerFace and conducted user studies. From the evaluation results, we conclude that PokerFace can have the competitiveness in game consoles market by giving more enjoyment and better memories for users.

375	GameSE_abstract	Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment of game AI for video game dead-end	"To create a satisfactory game opponent is to optimize player's experience through creation of an dynamic balanced game, which means that win-rate of players is adjusted according to their ability. The most commonly used approach for generating satisfactory game opponent is Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA), which is to dynamically adjust challenge level of the opponent according to the player's skill level. However, DDA currently used is relatively simple and implementing DDA by adjusting opponent's intelligence is still challenging. In this paper, we propose to use Artificial Neural Network(ANN) to implement DDA and unsupervised learning methodologies to improve the performance of ANN. ANN-controlled Non-Player Characters (NPC) can make ""wise"" decision based on collected attributes of all the characters in the game. Different ANNs can provide different win-rates for different player strategies, which can achieve the dynamic balance we expected and enhance the user experience of games."

376	GameSE_abstract	Reversely discovering and modifying properties based on active deep q-learning	Many researchers studied DQN (Deep Q-Networks) to train a game AI to beat human players, while we trained an improved AI to reversely modify properties of 3D video games. Our ultimate objective is to improve automatic debug for software and cloud services. However, the problem that reversely discovers properties in online 3D Video Games in an automatic way has not been studied yet. Therefore, related special difficulties are first discussed in the paper. RMDQN (a Reverse Method based on our active Deep Q-Networks) is proposed to deal with the problem, and an active DQN is invented to make the reverse procedure automatic and intelligent. The action engine of RMDQN is able to control any operational game object like a player is playing, which makes automatic debug possible. A video demonstration is provided to show the result of reversely modifying game properties by our method. It was proved that our method can improve debug technology in 3D video games, and it will be applied in cloud services with fewmodifications.

377	GameSE_abstract	Procedural content generation for general video game level generation	With the passage of time, video games are becoming more complex, and their development incurs greater time and cost. The creation of video gaming content such as levels, maps, textures and so on represent a large part of the overall cost of game development. Procedural Content Generation (PCG) is a method of generating content via a pseudo-random process. Level generation has been the most significant and oldest problem in the PCG domain. The majority of the PCG level generators are specific to a particular game, content is generated only for a suited single type and these generators are evaluated mostly by computational metrics, user studies and fitness functions. Considering, the grand goal of general Artificial Intelligence, it would be beneficial to sculpt solutions that are applicable to a general set of problems. For the level generation problem, this can be achieved by constructing a level generator that generates levels for a set of games and not explicitly for a single game. In this research, we have created four different types of generators for the GVG-LG framework. The generators follow a distinct path and are able to solve multiple problems related to PCG including dynamic difficulty adjustment, creation of intelligent controllers, creating aesthetically appealing levels and using patterns as objectives for level generation. In addition, we evaluated all the generators using a variety of techniques. The experimental results show promising results and represent our attempt at general video game level generation.

However, this commonly accepted practice can cause problems that are rarely discussed or presented. We unpack this practice by discussing some of its issues. As a practice that is central to game development, it is important to better understand the interactions of social, technical, and cultural factors that result in the creation of sophisticated software artifacts, i.e. computer games. We discuss some of these issues and sketch out a research agenda for their further exploration."

379	GameSE_abstract	Cost-efficient and reliable reporting of highly bursty video game crash data	Video game crash events are characterized primarily by large media payloads and by highly bursty traffic patterns, with hundreds of thousands or millions of reports being issued in only a few minutes. These events are invaluable in quickly responding to game breaking issues that directly impact user experience. Even the slightest delay in capturing, processing and reporting these events can lead to user abandonment and significant financial cost. A traditional standalone RESTful service, backed by a vertically scaled SQL database is neither a reliable nor costeffective solution to this problem. An architecture that decouples capture and persistence and uses a horizontally scalable NoSQL database is not only easier to provision, but also uses fewer cpu and memory resources to provide the same end to end latency and throughput. By replacing our RESTful implementation with one that takes advantage both of the aforementioned design and multitenant provisioning, we have reduced our dedicated cpu footprint by 63% and memory footprint by 59%. Additionally, we have decreased our data loss during spikes to essentially 0, maintained sub-second persistence latency and improved query latency in the average case by 54% with only a 3% sacrifice for worst case queries.

380	GameSE_abstract	Interactive floating windows: A new technique for stereoscopic video games	The film industry has a long history of creating compelling experiences in stereoscopic 3D. Recently, the video game as an artistic medium has matured into an effective way to tell engaging and immersive stories. Given the current push to bring stereoscopic 3D technology into the consumer market there is considerable interest to develop stereoscopic 3D video games. Game developers have largely ignored the need to design their games specifically for stereoscopic 3D and have thus relied on automatic conversion and driver technology. Game developers need to evaluate solutions used in other media, such as film, to correct perceptual problems such as window violations, and modify or create new solutions to work within an interactive framework. In this paper we extend the dynamic floating window technique into the interactive domain enabling the player to position a virtual window in space. Interactively changing the position, size, and the 3D rotation of the virtual window, objects can be made to 'break the mask' dramatically enhancing the stereoscopic effect. By demonstrating that solutions from the film industry can be extended into the interactive space, it is our hope that this initiates further discussion in the game development community to strengthen their story-telling mechanisms in stereoscopic 3D games.	3D; floating window; game design; stereoscopic; Video games	Zerebecki, C.; Stanfield, B.; Tawadrous, M.; Buckstein, D.; Hogue, A.; Kapralos, B.

381	GameSE_abstract	Taking the scenic route: Automatic exploration for videogames	Machine playtesting tools and game moment search engines require exposure to the diversity of a game's state space if they are to report on or index the most interesting moments of possible play. Meanwhile, mobile app distribution services would like to quickly determine if a freshly-uploaded game is fit to be published. Having access to a semantic map of reachable states in the game would enable efficient inference in these applications. However, human gameplay data is expensive to acquire relative to the coverage of a game that it provides. We show that off-the-shelf automatic exploration strategies can explore with an effectiveness comparable to human gameplay on the same timescale. We contribute generic methods for quantifying exploration quality as a function of time and demonstrate our metric on several elementary techniques and human players on a collection of commercial games sampled from multiple game platforms (from Atari 2600 to Nintendo 64). Emphasizing the diversity of states reached and the semantic map extracted, this work makes productive contrast with the focus on finding a behavior policy or optimizing game score used in most automatic game playing research.

382	GameSE_abstract	Towards efficient edge cloud augmentation for virtual reality MMOGs	With the popularity of Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies, VR-MMOGs are developing quickly, demanding ever faster gaming interactions and image rendering. In this paper, we identify three main challenges of VR-MMOGs: (1)a stringent latency requirement for frequent local view change responses, (2) a high bandwidth requirement for constant refreshing, and (3)a large scale requirement for a large number of simultaneous players. Understanding that a cloud-centric gaming architecture may struggle to deliver the latency/bandwidth requirements, the game development community is attempting to leverage edge cloud computing. However, one problem remains unsolved: how to distribute the work among the user device, the edge clouds, and the center cloud to meet all three requirements especially when users are mobile. In this paper, we propose a hybrid gaming architecture that achieves clever work distribution. It places local view change updates on edge clouds for immediate responses, frame rendering on edge clouds for high bandwidth, and global game state updates on the center cloud for user scalability. In addition, we propose an efficient service placement algorithm based on a Markov decision process. This algorithm dynamically places a user's gaming service on edge clouds while the user moves through different access points. It also co-places multiple users to facilitate game world sharing and reduce the overall migration overhead. We derive optimal solutions and devise efficient heuristic approaches. We also study different algorithm implementations to speed up the runtime. Through detailed simulation studies, we validate our placement algorithms and also show that our architecture has the potential to meet all three requirements of VR-MMOGs.

384	GameSE_abstract	Example-based rapid generation of vegetation on terrain via CNN-based distribution learning	Modeling large-scale vegetation on terrain is an important and challenging task in computer games, movie production and other digital entertainment applications. In this work, we propose a novel example-based method for rapid generation of vegetation in outdoor natural environments. Its central idea is to learn the vegetation distribution on terrain via deep convolution neural networks. We first use a pre-trained deep neural network to extract rich local information from the terrain pertinent to vegetation distribution. Second, we produce the initial features of the target vegetation distribution based on patch matching and further introduce a network that generates a vegetation density map based on the initial features. Third, during the synthesis stage, we propose a procedural method to generate the vegetation distribution data corresponding to the terrain data. Our research work confirms that the image features extracted by the pre-trained deep neural network could be utilized to explore the connection between vegetation and terrain. We validate our new method over various outdoor scenes, including procedural generated scenes and scenes with manual control on tree patterns. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can rapidly produce new realistic scenes for outdoor natural environments, which relies on the mechanism of learning correlationship between vegetation distribution and terrain data.

385	GameSE_abstract	Procedural modeling of rivers from single image toward natural scene production	The rapid and flexible design of natural environments is an important yet challenging task in graphics simulation, virtual reality, and video game productions. This is particularly difficult for natural river modeling due to its complex topology, geometric diversity, and its natural interaction with the complicated terrain. In this paper, we introduce an integrated method for example-based procedural modeling to overcome such difficulties. First, we propose a compact parametric model to represent the certain river, which inherits typical features of natural rivers such as tributary, distributary, tortuosity, possible lakes adjacent to the river. Then, we demonstrate our method for generating 3D river scene solely based on the parametric model. However, choosing appropriate parameters is a tedious undertaking in practice. To further enhance our method's functionality, we rely upon a natural river image to extract meaningful parameters toward the rapid procedural production of the new river scene. Finally, we design a new method to compare two river scenes and iteratively optimize the river network by using the simulated annealing technique. Our method can produce natural river scenes from an example river network and single terrain image with little interaction, and the synthesized scene is visually consistent with the input example in terms of feature similarity. We also demonstrate that our procedural modeling approach is highly automatic toward rapid scene production through various graphics examples.

387	GameSE_abstract	Battracker: High precision infrastructure-free mobile device tracking in indoor environments	Continuous tracking of the device location in 3D space is a popular form of user input, especially for virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), video games and health rehabilitation. Conventional inertial based approaches are well known for inaccuracy caused by large error drifts. Computer vision approaches can produce accuracy tracking but have privacy concerns and are subject to lighting conditions and computation complexity. Recent work exploits accurate acoustic distance measurements for high precision tracking. However, they require additional hardware (e.g., multiple external speakers), which adds to the costs and installation efforts, thus limiting the convenience and usability. In this paper, we propose BatTracker, which incorporates inertial and acoustic data for robust, high precision and infrastructure-free tracking in indoor environments. BatTracker leverages echoes from nearby objects and uses distance measurements from them to correct error accumulation in inertial based device position prediction. It incorporates Doppler shifts and echo amplitudes to reliably identify the association between echoes and objects despite noisy signals from multi-path reflection and cluttered environment. A probabilistic algorithm creates, prunes and evolves multiple hypotheses based on measurement evidences to accommodate uncertainty in device position. Experiments in real environments show that BatTracker can track a mobile device's movements in 3D space at sub-cm level accuracy, comparable to the state-of-the-art infrastructure based approaches, while eliminating the needs of any additional hardware.

388	GameSE_abstract	From 101 to nnn: A review and a classification of computer game architectures	The game world graph (GWG) framework is a taxonomy for analyzing and classifying computer game architectures. This article presents a systematic review of game architectures using the GWG framework. The review validates the usefulness of the GWG framework through classifying game architectures described in the literature into distinct categories according to the framework. The major contribution of the paper is a state-of-the-art presentation of 40 different game architectures, which covers architectures for all kinds of games from single player games to massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs). Previous reviews of game architectures have focused on a narrower selection of games such as only networked games, MMOGs or similar. Further, none of the previous reviews has used a systematic framework for analyzing the characteristics of game architectures. Using the framework, we can identify similarities and differences of the 40 game architectures in a systematic way. Finally, the paper outlines the evolution of the game architectures from the perspective of the GWG framework.

389	GameSE_abstract	Graph of game worlds: New perspectives on video game architectures	Software architectures of video games have evolved radically over the past decade. Researchers and practitioners have proposed architectural patterns such as stand-alone configuration, peer-to-peer, client server and hybrid, and some of them have successfully been used in commercial game titles. A conceptual framework for game architectures - Game Worlds Graph (GWG) - is presented in this paper for three purposes: 1) classifying existing architectures, 2) communicating and sense-making of game architectures, and 3) exploring and discovering future game architectures. The framework is based on the Game World and the World Connector concepts, which reveal some essential characteristics of game architectures - thus can be more descriptive and informative than existing taxonomies.

390	GameSE_abstract	RAIL: A domain-specific language for generating NPC behaviors in action/adventure game	Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM) has shown its effectiveness of improving software productivity in many software domains [1], where Domain Specific Language (DSL) plays a key role. Also in the domain of video games, researchers have proposed various DSLs for developing different aspects of several game genres. This paper presents a DSL named RAIL for generating Non-Playable Character (NPC) behaviors in Action/Adventure Games. Our DSL borrows concepts from State Machines and adds some features to better suit the target domain. Further, we have implemented a tool-chain for RAIL using the Eclipse language workbench, and the tool-chain has been integrated with the level editor of the Torque2D game engine. To evaluate the DSL, we developed a prototype game and collected data regarding the development time and code lines. The results showed that RAIL significantly improves the productivity of developing NPC behaviors in the target game with a reasonable associated cost. In addition, the integration of the RAIL and the Torque 2D tool-chains provides a smooth development workflow.	Domain specific language; Game development; NPC behavior	Zhu, M.; Wang, A.I.

In order to pursue the game experience, how to use artificial intelligence in the game has become a new research hotspot. Therefore, the current situation of artificial intelligence used in games was investigated, and the principles of Unity3D game engine were studied; then the intelligent behavior model for NPC was established by using the behavior tree as the basic algorithm, and the AI architecture of the agent in the game was designed; moreover, combined with the above analysis, the behavior tree model based on Q learning algorithm was calculated, and the application of Unity3D in the game was completed; finally, a game model was developed in combination with Unity3D game engine. The results show that the behavior tree based on Unity3D game engine can realize NPC's intelligent behavior simply and efficiently, and the system can run at a good speed, which has theoretical guidance for the follow-up research of game artificial intelligence and simulation training.	behavior tree; intelligent behavior; non-player character (NPC); Unity3D	Zhu, X.

393	GameSE_abstract	Jury API: Secure client-side-only multiplayer gaming API	Multiplayer gaming platforms (such as Come2Play, Skype, Nonoba, Oberon) offer game developers an API to develop new games. Having a secure API is critical to prevent hackers from unlawfully winning a game. Until today, to have a secure API, a developer had to write a server-side extension that determines the game outcome. However, a server-side extension is cumbersome to write (because you have to master two programming languages: for the client- and server-side), error-prone, hard to debug, and risky for the gaming platform that runs 3rdparty code on its servers. This paper presents the first Secure client-side-only API (for short JuryAPI), i.e., the API is secure (the game outcome cannot be changed by hackers) and the API uses only client-side code (without any server-side extensions). JuryAPI mimics real-life games in which each player verifies that other players follow the game rules. In case of disagreement among the players, the server convenes a jury that finds the hacker. Using JuryAPI, one can develop secure multiplayer games using only client-side code, without using any server-side extensions. JuryAPI is an open-source standard developed by the multiplayer gaming company Come2Play, with an open-source flash emulator1. Come2Play freely hosts 3rdparty flash games and shares the revenues with the game developers.

394	GameSE_abstract	Software Analytics for Digital Games	Software and its development generates an inordinate amount of data. Development activities such as check-ins, work items, bug reports, code reviews, and test executions are recorded in software repositories. User interactions that reflect how customers experience software are recorded in telemetry data, run-time traces, and log files and helps to track application and feature usage and expose performance and reliability. Software analytics takes this data and turns it into actionable insight to better inform decisions related to software. In this talk, I will summarize our efforts in the area of software analytics with a special focus on digital games. I will present several examples of games studies, which we have worked on at Microsoft Research such as how players are engaged in Project Gotham Racing, how skill develops over time in Halo Reach and Forza Motor sports, and the initial experience of game play. I will also point out important differences between games development and traditional software development.

395	GameSE_abstract	The Effect of UI and UX enhancement on bomberman game based on game experience questionnaire	User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) are aspects that cannot be separated from video game development. In this study, we have improved the UI and UX of the Bomberman game and compared it to the UI and UX of the original Bomberman game. In evaluating the UI and UX results, we use the Game Experience Questionnaire Method (GEQ). There are six aspects used in the GEQ method, i.e., aspects of the challenge, competition, immersion, playfulness, social experiment, and enjoyment. We use 65 respondents to rate the UI and UX of the original Bomberman game. The questionnaire's results were taken into consideration in improving the UI and UX of the game to be developed. GEQ also provided to get the result of the improvement game. Likert scale calculation concluded that the 62 respondents rated the success of the Bomberman game development with UI and UX that has been improved. The 62 respondents indicated that the UI and UX of games provide more fun and enjoyable than the original Bomberman game.	game experience questionnaire; improved game; user experience; user interface	Zulfa, N.; Yuniasri, D.; Damayanti, P.; Herumurti, D.; Yunanto, A.A.

396	GameSE_abstract	Software engineering research for computer games: A systematic review	Context: Currently, computer game development is one of the fastest growing industries in the worldwide economy. In addition to that, computer games are rapidly evolving in the sense that newer game versions arrive in a very short interval. Thus, software engineering techniques are needed for game development in order to achieve greater flexibility and maintainability, less cost and effort, better design, etc. In addition, games present several characteristics that differentiate their development from classical software development.Objective: This study aims to assess the state of the art on research concerning software engineering for computer games and discuss possible important areas for future research.Method: We employed a standard methodology for systematic literature reviews using four well known digital libraries.Results: Software engineering for computer games is a research domain that has doubled its research activity during the last 5 years. The dominant research topic has proven to be requirements engineering, while topics such as software verification and maintenance have been neglected up to now.Conclusion: The results of the study suggest that software engineering for computer games is a field that embraces many techniques and methods from conventional software engineering and adapts them so as to fit the specific requirements of game development. In addition to that, the study proposes the employment of more elaborate empirical methods, i.e. controlled experiments and case studies, in game software engineering research, which, have not been extensively used up to now.

397	GameSE_abstract	Developing video games with elementary adaptive artificial intelligence in unity: An intelligent systems approach	Video games have increasingly demonstrated a great deal of audiovisual realism, in par with the massive performance improvement of computer systems. At the same time, their Artificial Intelligence (AI) component falls short in terms of realism because it is usually based on non-adaptive methods. Adaptive AI mechanisms can help increase video game realism allowing the game to adapt in real-time to the game progress and the user behavior. Following a short overview of the progress of AI in video games in the past years, this paper highlights the creation of modern video games with basic and elementary adaptive game AI using the Unity game development framework. Particular emphasis is on the details of the AI component. First, a shooter game with basic AI is created. Finally, an action-adventure video game is created featuring elementary case-based adaptive AI. The objective in this game is to create enemies which are able to perceive changes in the environment and adapt their strategies accordingly. Proposed AI practices can migrate into relevant real world applications, such as video surveillance and intrusion detection systems, mission critical autonomous networked patrolling and/or save and rescue robots, vision and hearing assistive applications, intelligent video and behavioral analytics to detect and predict threats etc.	Games; Intelligent systems; Adaptive systems; Real-time systems; Graphics; Task analysis; Artificial Intelligence; Video Games; Adaptive Artificial Intelligence; Environmental Changes; Video Surveillance; Game Development; Intrusion Detection System; Decision Tree; Online Learning; Nightmares; State Machine; Complex Decision; Boolean Variable; Artificial Intelligence Research; Part Of Code; Game Environment; Simulation Games; Game Conditions; Strategy Games; Human Players; Case-based Reasoning; Gameplay; Firing Range; Ray Casting; Human-like Behavior; Machine Guns; Wear Off; Code Section; game AI; adaptive game AI; case-based adaptive game AI; intrusion detection; networked patrolling robots; Unity	Apostolos Meliones; Ioannis Plas	2017 Intelligent Systems Conference (IntelliSys)	https://doi.org/10.1109/IntelliSys.2017.8324230	"1.S.

398	GameSE_abstract	Usability Assessment Heuristics in New Genre Videogames	In this paper, we introduce a new set of heuristics that can be used to carry out usability studies on new genre video games. The definition new genre games refers to videogames that use specific and unique equipment or are part of a general software category such as platforms of social networking. Based on videogame usability problems stated in game reviews on relevant websites and in earlier scientific researches, heuristics were developed to help resolve usability problems in gameplay and game interface level. In addition usability problems concerning new genre videogames were identified through an integrated experimental procedure that took place in HOU's quality assessment laboratory or in players' own place by using suitable software developed by the Software Quality Research Group (SQRG) to simulate laboratory functions. Once the heuristics had been developed, they were applied on the observation procedure during the players' encounters with the games Wii Sports and Pet Society (used inside the famous networking platform Facebook). The validity of heuristics is tested through two different usability evaluating methods; users logging and heuristic evaluation.	combined usability assessment methods; heuristics; heuristic evaluation; new genre videogames	Papaloukas, Spyridon; Patriarcheas, Kiriakos; Xenos, Michalis	13TH PANHELLENIC CONFERENCE ON INFORMATICS, PROCEEDINGS	https://doi.org/10.1109/PCI.2009.14		202-206		Included	Included	new_screen			2	Web of Science	2009	Usability Assessment Heuristics In New Genre Videogames	https://doi.org/10.1109/PCI.2009.14	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
399	GameSE_abstract	Application of combinatorial tests in video game testing	Video games comprise a multi-billion-dollar industry. Companies invest huge amounts of money for the release of their games. A part of this money is invested in testing the games. Current game testing methods include manual execution of pre-written test cases in the game. Each test case may or may not result in a bug. In a game, a bug is said to occur when the game does not behave per its intended design. The process of writing the test cases to test games requires standardization. We believe that this standardization can be achieved by implementing experimental design to video game testing. In this research, we discuss the implementation of combinatorial testing, specifically covering arrays, to test games. Combinatorial testing is a method of experimental design that is used to generate test cases and is primarily used for commercial software testing. In addition to the discussion of the implementation of combinatorial testing techniques in video game testing, we present an algorithm that can be used to sort test cases to aid developers in finding the combination of settings resulting in a bug.	covering arrays; experimental design; fault interaction	Sagi, Bhargava Rohit; Silvestrini, Rachel	QUALITY ENGINEERING	https://doi.org/10.1080/08982112.2017.1300919		745-759		Included	Included	new_screen			2	Web of Science	2017	Application Of Combinatorial Tests In Video Game Testing	https://doi.org/10.1080/08982112.2017.1300919	TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
400	GameSE_abstract	XML-Based Video Game Description Language	This paper presents the XML-based Video Game Description Language (XVGDL), a new language for specifying Video games which is based on the Extensible Markup Language (XML). The proposal is portable and extensible, and allows games to not only be defined at engine level but also includes specific features that can lead the game design process whilst simultaneously reducing the gap between game specification and its corresponding game implementation. XVGDL is as generic as possible, making it possible to describe different genres of games. This paper focuses on presenting the basis of the language. The paper describes the syntax as well as the components of XVGDL, and provides examples of their use. Defining games via XML structures provides all the advantages of the management of XML files and opens up interesting lines of research. Our proposal provides a number of novel features. So, XVGDL game definitions can be managed as any other XML file, which means that it can be automatically handled by any XML file management software. Another interesting feature is that XVGDL can specify game components (e.g., game Artificial), in-game processes (e.g., the procedural generation of maps) or in-game events (e.g., the checking of the conditions to end a game match) via the association with external (possibly non-XML) files. Moreover, XVGDL files can be easily validated as any XML file what means that validations against a particular Document Type Definition (DTD) or XML Schema Definition (XSD) are possible. In addition, the paper presents a first prototype implementation of a (text-based) interpreter that allows XVGDL game specifications as a playable game to be executed. This tool not only validates our proposal but also represents a first step towards smoothing the path to obtaining an executable version of a game from its game specification.

In this paper, we have performed rhythmic analysis of General Video Game Level Generation (GVG-LG) framework and have discerned 23 common design patterns. In addition, we have segregated the identified patterns into four unique classes. The categorization is based on the usage of identified patterns in game levels. Our future aim is to employ these patterns as an input for a search based level generator.

""PyVGDL"" is a simple, high-level, extensible description language for 2-D video games. It is based on defining locations and dynamics for simple building blocks (objects), together with local interaction effects. A rich ontology defines various controllers, object behaviors, passive effects (physics), and collision effects. It can be used to quickly design games, without having to deal with control structures. We show how the dynamics of many classical games can be generated from a few lines of PyVGDL. Furthermore, the accompanying software library permits parsing and instantly playing those games, visualized froma bird's-eye or first-person viewpoint, and using them as benchmarks for learning algorithms."

403	GameSE_abstract	Model Checking in multiplayer games development	Multiplayer computer games play a big role in the ever-growing entertainment industry. Being competitive in this industry means releasing the best possible software, and reliability is a key feature to win the market. Computer games are also actively used to simulate different robotic systems where reliability is even more important, and potentially critical. Traditional software testing approaches can check a subset of all the possible program executions, and they can never guarantee complete absence of errors in the source code. On the other hand, during more than twenty years, Model Checking has demonstrated to be a powerful instrument for formal verification of large hardware and software components. In this paper, we contribute with a novel approach to formally verify computer games. We propose a method of model construction that starts from a computer game description and utilizes Model Checking technique. We apply the method on a case study: the game Penguin Clash. Finally, an approach to game model reduction (and its implementation) is introduced in order to address the state explosion problem.	model checking; multiplayer games; formal verification; multi agent systems; game development	Rezin, Ruslan; Afanasyev, Ilya; Mazzara, Manuel; Rivera, Victor	PROCEEDINGS 2018 IEEE 32ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED INFORMATION NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS (AINA)	https://doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2018.00122		826-833		Included	Included	new_screen			2	Web of Science	2018	Model Checking In Multiplayer Games Development	https://doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2018.00122	IEEE	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

406	GameSE_abstract	The ANGELINA Videogame Design System-Part II	Procedural content generation is generally viewed as a means to an end-a tool employed by designers to overcome technical problems or achieve a particular design goal. When we move from generating single parts of games to automating the entirety of their design, however, we find ourselves facing a far wider and more interesting set of problems than mere generation. When the designer of a game is a piece of software, we face questions about what it means to be a designer, about computational creativity, and about how to assess the growth of these automated game designers and the value of their output. Answering these questions can lead to new ideas in how to generate content procedurally, and produce systems that can further the cutting edge of game design. This paper describes work done to take an automated game designer and advance it towards being a member of a creative community. We outline extensions made to the system to give it more autonomy and creative independence, in order to strengthen claims that the software is acting creatively. We describe and reflect upon the software's participation in the games community, including entering two game development contests, and show the opportunities and difficulties of such engagement. We consider methods for evaluating automated game designers as creative entities, and underline the need for automated game design to be a major frontier in future games research.

407	GameSE_abstract	Method for Game Development Driven by User-eXperience: A Study of Rework, Productivity and Complexity of Use	The growing capabilities and revenues of video game development are important factors for software companies. However, game development processes could be considered immature, specifically in the design phase. Ambiguous requirements in game design cause rework. User-eXperience (UX) is usually assessed at the end of the development process, causing difficulties to ensure the interactive experience between the game and users. To reduce these problems, this paper proposes a method for Game Development driven by User-eXperience (GameD-UX) that integrates a repository based on requirements engineering, a model for user experience management, and an adjusted agile process. Two experiments were conducted to study rework and productivity of video game development. Results of the first experiment revealed that GameD-UX causes less rework than conventional approaches, but it induces lower productivity. A tool for supporting the GameD-UX method was developed by considering the lessons learned. The second experiment showed that the software tool increases the productivity and reduces the complexity of use of GameD-UX.

408	GameSE_abstract	A software development process model for gesture-based interface	Gesture-based applications have particularities, since users interact in a natural way, much as they interact in the non-digital world. Hence, new requirements are needed on the software design process. This paper shows a software development process model for these applications, including requirement specification, design, implementation, and testing procedures. The steps and activities of the proposed model were tested through a game case study, which is a puzzle game. The puzzle is completed when all pieces of a painting are correctly positioned by the drag and drop action of users hand gesture. It also shows the results obtained of applying a heuristic evaluation on this game.

409	GameSE_abstract	Study of Methodology of Testing Mobile Games based on TTCN-3	Systematic software testing play's a critical role in software development. Various approaches have beef? proposed and developed, but software testing is still far from maturity A very, promising strategy is model-based testing that is aimed to automatically generate test cases and evaluate test results based on the software models that specify, the behavior of the software under test. In this paper we propose a general rule model for mobile games by combining the features of the game software and the Wireless Application Protocol. We also build an adjusted model for generating test cases with the characteristics of mobile game software. A series of patterns are created to facilitate the generation of TTCN-3 test suite and test case. A case study, on the Fruit Machine game is discussed to illustrate the use of the proposed model for software testing.

410	GameSE_abstract	uOS : A resource rerouting middleware for ubiquitous games	Ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) relies on the computation distributed over the environment to simplify the tasks performed by its users. A smart space is an instance of a ubiquitous environment, composed of a dynamic and heterogeneous set of devices that interact to support the execution of distributed smart applications. In this context, mobile devices provide new resources when they join the environment, which disappear when they leave it. This introduces the challenge of self-adaptation, in which smart applications may either include new resources as they become available or replace them when they become unavailable. Ubiquitous games combine ubicomp and computer game technologies to enrich user's experience and fun. Such games may benefit from different input and output resources offered by mobile devices. To support the development and deployment of ubiquitous games, this work presents the uOS middleware. Using a DSOA (Device Service Oriented Architecture) based architecture and lightweight service discovery protocols, uOS ensures compatibility among resources, providing resource rerouting between heterogeneous and limited software and hardware platforms. The uMoleHunt game is presented to illustrate the practical application of uOS.		Buzeto, Fabricio N.; Capretz, Miriam A.

411	GameSE_abstract	Game level layout from design specification	The design of video game environments, or levels, aims to control gameplay by steering the player through a sequence of designer-controlled steps, while simultaneously providing a visually engaging experience. Traditionally these levels are painstakingly designed by hand, often from pre-existing building blocks, or space templates. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic approach for automatically laying out game levels from user-specified blocks. Our method allows designers to retain control of the gameplay flow via user-specified level connectivity graphs, while relieving them from the tedious task of manually assembling the building blocks into a valid, plausible layout. Our method produces sequences of diverse layouts for the same input connectivity, allowing for repeated replay of a given level within a visually different, new environment. We support complex graph connectivities and various building block shapes, and are able to compute complex layouts in seconds. The two key components of our algorithm are the use of configuration spaces defining feasible relative positions of building blocks within a layout and a graph-decomposition based layout strategy that leverages graph connectivity to speed up convergence and avoid local minima. Together these two tools quickly steer the solution toward feasible layouts. We demonstrate our method on a variety of real-life inputs, and generate appealing layouts conforming to user specifications.

412	GameSE_abstract	FANTASIA: a framework for advanced natural tools and applications in social, interactive approaches	With the recent availability of industry-grade, high-performing engines for video games production, researchers in different fields have been exploiting the advanced technologies offered by these artefacts to improve the quality of the interactive experiences they design. While these engines provide excellent and easy-to-use tools to design interfaces and complex rule-based systems to control the experience, there are some aspects of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research they do not support in the same way because of their original mission and related design patterns pointing at a different primary target audience. In particular, the more research in HCI evolves towards natural, socially engaging approaches, the more there is the need to rapidly design and deploy software architectures to support these new paradigms. Topics such as knowledge representation, probabilistic reasoning and voice synthesis demand space as possible instruments within this new ideal design environment. In this work, we propose a framework, named FANTASIA, designed to integrate a set of chosen modules (a graph database, a dialogue manager, a game engine and a voice synthesis engine) and support rapid design and implementation of interactive applications for HCI studies. We will present a number of different case studies to exemplify how the proposed tools can be deployed to develop very different kinds of interactive applications and we will discuss ongoing and future work to further extend the framework we propose.

413	GameSE_abstract	Analysis and Exploitation of Synchronized Parallel Executions in Behavior Trees	Behavior Trees (BTs) are becoming a popular tool to model the behaviors of autonomous agents in the computer game and the robotics industry. One of the key advantages of BTs lies in their composability, where complex behaviors can be built by composing simpler ones. The parallel composition is the one with the highest potential since the complexity of composing pre-existing behaviors in parallel is much lower than the one needed using classical control architectures as finite state machines. However, the parallel composition is rarely used due to the underlying concurrency problems that are similar to the ones faced in concurrent programming.In this paper, we define two synchronization techniques to tackle the concurrency problems in BTs compositions and we show how to exploit them to improve behavior predictability. Also, we introduce measures to assess execution performance and we show how design choices can affect them.To illustrate the proposed framework, we provide a set of experiments using the R1 robot and we gather statistically-significant data.

415	GameSE_abstract	Towards large scale high fidelity collaborative augmented reality	In recent years, there has been an increasing amount of Collaborative Augmented Reality (CAR) experiences, classifiable by the deployed scale and the fidelity of the experience. In this paper, we create HoloRoyale, the first large scale high fidelity (LSHF) CAR experience. We do this by first exploring the LSHF CAR design space, drawing on technical implementations and design aspects from AR and video games. We then create and implement a software architecture that improves the accuracy of synchronized poses between multiple users. Finally, we apply our target experience and technical implementation to the explored design space. A core design component of HoloRoyale is the use of visual repellers as crowd control elements to guide players away from undesired areas. To evaluate the effectiveness of the employed visual repellers in a LSHF CAR context we conducted a user study, deploying HoloRoyale in a 12.500 m(2) area. The results from the user study suggest that visual repellers are effective crowd control elements that do not significantly impact the user's overall immersion. Overall our main contribution is the exploration of a design space, discussing several means to address the challenges of LSHF CAR, the creation of a system capable of LSHF CAR interactions along with an experience that has been fitted to the design space, and an indepth study that verifies a key design aspect for LSHF CAR. As such, our work is the first to explore the domain of LSHF CAR and provides insight into designing experiences in other AR domains.

417	GameSE_abstract	GDGSE: Game Development with Global Software Engineering	The management models and skilled workforce required for game development is different from those of traditional software development. Multidisciplinary nature of the game development process requires people with different skills and incurs higher cost as compared to traditional software engineering. Global software engineering (GSE), which involves the development of top level software projects by different teams located around the globe, can be used for game development. The core benefits offered by GSE include reduced costs and increased workforce skillset through coordination of people with diverse expertise. However, such integration of widely distributed teams requires efficient communication and coordination which is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a global game development methodology. This methodology makes the game development process more cost effective. In this methodology, we combine the concept of game development methodology with GSE. Furthermore, successful team coordination will be achieved by proper documentation and prototyping in the pre-production phase of our methodology. This combination will provide a means of communicating functionality and interaction as a single package to the team.

418	GameSE_abstract	Simulator X: A scalable and concurrent architecture for intelligent realtime interactive systems	This article presents a platform for software technology research in the area of intelligent Realtime Interactive Systems. Simulator X is targeted at Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, and computer games. It provides a foundation and testbed for a variety of different application models. The current research architecture is based on the actor model to support fine grained concurrency and parallelism. Its design follows the minimize coupling and maximize cohesion software engineering principle. A distributed world state and execution scheme is combined with an object-centered world view based on an entity model. Entities conceptually aggregate properties internally represented by state variables. An asynchronous event mechanism allows intra- and interprocess communication between the simulation actors. An extensible world interface uses an ontology-based semantic annotation layer to provide a coherent world view of the resulting distributed world state and execution scheme to application developers. The world interface greatly simplifies configurability and the semantic layer provides a solid foundation for the integration of different Artificial Intelligence components. The current architecture is implemented in Scala using the Java virtual machine. This choice additionally fosters low-level scalability, portability, and reusability.

420	GameSE_abstract	Modeling of Jigsaw Game Software with a Map Using UML	In view of the problem that current jigsaw games have no functions of upgrades or accumulation scores, the UML (Unified Modeling Language) technology is adopted to analyze to design the mobile game software via spitting jigsaw puzzle pieces of a map. The results of software development illustrate that it is very easy to upgrade and accumulate scores. The gaps between design and coding are smaller using UML than before. Also, the software development period is shorter. Not only the material resources for entity toys can be saved greatly via this software, but also it is significant for children users to study the knowledge of map and traffic.

421	GameSE_abstract	Architectural Convergence and Platform Evolution: Empirical Test of Complementor Moves in Videogames	While it is widely known that the success of platforms requires consistent support from complementors, scant attention has been paid to understand the moves of complementors in dynamic settings. In this paper, we focus on platform evolution from the sixth to the seventh generation of videogames and studied the strategic moves of third-party developers that supported personal computer and videogame consoles during a period of architectural convergence. We theorize how platform attachment capability of third-party developers (complementors to platforms) influence developers' strategic choice. We analyze their choices through two strategic moves-porting (launching an existing game on another platform) versus augmentation (launching a new game on a platform) using data on 316 developers over a nine-year period. We find that complementors that are more embedded in single platform-technologies are unable to leverage their existing knowledge in new platform settings and hence, are less likely to engage in porting moves but support existing platforms through augmentation. Complementors are also more likely to port titles to platforms that were architecturally similar to their previously supported platforms. Architectural convergence across sixth and seventh generations of videogames affords even previously embedded developers an opportunity to migrate and support disparate platforms. The results underscore the importance of framing how platform providers and complementors coevolve their actions to respond to platform evolution and architectural convergence from a dyadic and dynamic perspective.

422	GameSE_abstract	How applicable is ISO/IEC 29110 in game software development?	Software development in a small development team is a challenge, as people have to fulfill several roles, which in larger groups would have separate, dedicated people for the work. To help small development teams to organize their activities, ISO/IEC standardization body has developed the standard ISO/IEC 29110, Lifecycle profiles for Very Small Entities. Our study focuses on the application of this model in the game industry, an industry that develops software. However, the game industry has its own set of unusual features in software development, such as the demand for artistic vision, need for novelty and demand for creative designs. In this study we analyze how the standard would work in seven different game industry companies and identify a set of additions that would help these organizations to apply the standard in practice. Based on our results, the ISO/IEC 29110 should incorporate more support for iterative development to allow easier adaptation to real-life organizations.

423	GameSE_abstract	Game development life cycle guidelines	Game is a kind of software with goal to provide entertainment. However, during the real game development practice, simply adopting the software development life cycle (SDLC) is not enough, as the developers face several challenges during its life cycle. To address the problem, game development uses a kind of specific approach called game development life cycle (GDLC) to direct the game development. However, none of the existing GDLCs explicitly address how to successfully deliver a good quality game. This paper presents a new game development life cycle model and guidelines to successfully deliver a good quality game. Several quality criterias are explicitly considered at each phase.

424	GameSE_abstract	Software Abstraction for Casual Games Using Temporal Model: an Alloy-based Approach	Software abstraction plays an important role in both requirements engineering and software design. It facilitates the principle of separate of concerns while opening the door for software automation. This paper revisits the notion of software abstraction made for casual games where a single player accumulates her points by performing game activities under a set of rules. We propose to make software abstraction in Alloy - a lightweight, declarative language that is semantically based on first-order logic and syntactically being object-oriented. We show that casual games can be conceptually abstracted and semantically represented in Alloy. More specifically, game concepts (e.g., the main player, gold mine) are represented under Alloy signatures while game rules (e.g., game over, score upped/downed) as Alloy fact. To precisely specify game rules and make them simulatable, we need a mechanism for querying and updating the states of game concepts at different moments during the course of the game. To this end, we employ temporal modeling in making software abstraction for casual games.

425	GameSE_abstract	Development of a User-Interactive Agent Simulation System with the Blackboard Architectural Pattern	Involving the user in a simulated world introduces a new prospective in the agent-based simulation research. We propose a method of using a game development platform in designing a multiagent system based on the Blackboard architectural pattern, which provides a practical scenario to traffic simulation by showing the interaction between the pedestrians and the vehicles. Besides generating the log on the incidents happening and letting the user observe the simulation, our system also allows the user to get involved in the simulated world as a driver of a vehicle to interact with other cars and people walking around. The issues in analyzing the requirements of agents and implementing agents in an existing platform introduce a new challenge in software design. This work is a result of our agent-based software engineering research and reports a design method of integrating an existing platform with an architectural pattern to realize agent-based simulation in hosting different types of drivers and pedestrians in a simulated city blocks.	multiagent system; agent simulation; Blackboard architectural pattern; traffic simulation; user involvement	Tai, David; Wu, Power; Liu, Alan	2018 25TH ASIA-PACIFIC SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CONFERENCE (APSEC 2018)	https://doi.org/10.1109/APSEC.2018.00018		41-48		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen		AI: Studies that were focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI).	2	Web of Science	2018	Development Of A User-Interactive Agent Simulation System With The Blackboard Architectural Pattern	https://doi.org/10.1109/APSEC.2018.00018	IEEE	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
426	GameSE_abstract	A Flexible Model-Driven Game Development Approach	Game developers are facing an increasing demand for new games every year. Game development tools can be of great help, but require highly specialized professionals. Also, just as any software development effort, game development has some challenges. Model-Driven Game Development (MDGD) is suggested as a means to solve some of these challenges, but with a loss in flexibility. We propose a MDGD approach that combines multiple domain-specific languages (DSLs) with design patterns to provide flexibility and allow generated code to be integrated with manual code. After experimentation, we observed that, with the approach, less experienced developers can create games faster and more easily, and the product of code generation can be customized with manually written code, providing flexibility. However, with MDGD, developers become less familiar with the code, making manual codification more difficult.

427	GameSE_abstract	What is a Minimum Viable (Video) Game? Towards a Research Agenda	The concept of 'Minimum Viable Product' (MVP) is largely adapted in the software industry as well as in academia. Minimum viable products are used to test hypotheses regarding the target audience, save resources from unnecessary development work and guide a company towards a stable business model. As the game industry is becoming an important business domain, it is not surprise that the concept has been adopted also in the game development. This study surveys how a Minimum Viable Game (MVG) is defined, what is reported in extant literature as well as present results from a small case study survey done to nine game development companies. The study shows that despite popularity of minimum viable games in the industrial fora, the presented views on the concept are diverged and there is lack of practical guidelines and research supporting game companies. This study points out research gaps in the area as well as calls for actions to further develop the concept and to define guidelines.

To understand this problem and number of other aspects such as Green IT and business models, we conducted a survey with the game industry organizations.

429	GameSE_abstract	PALLAS: Mapping applications onto manycore	Parallel programming using the current state-of-the-art in software engineering techniques is hard. Expertise in parallel programming is necessary to deliver good performance in applications; however, it is very common that domain experts lack the requisite expertise in parallel programming. In order to drive the computer science research toward effectively using the available parallel hardware platforms, it is very important to make parallel programming systematical and productive. We believe that the key to designing parallel programs in a systematical way is software architecture, and the key to improve the productivity of developing parallel programs is software frameworks. The basis of both is design patterns and a pattern language. We illustrate how we can use design patterns to architect a wide variety of real applications, including image recognition, speech recognition, optical ?ow computation, video background subtraction, compressed sensing MRI, computational finance, video games, and machine translation. By exploring software architectures of our applications, we achieved 10x-140x speedups in each of the applications. We illustrate how we can develop parallel programs productively using application frameworks and programming frameworks. We achieve 50%-100% of the performance while using four times fewer lines of code compared to hand-optimized code.

We address issues such as primitive order, vertex reuse, and screen-space derivatives of dependent variables, which are essential to real-world applications, but have largely been ignored by comparable work in the past. The power of a software approach lies in the ability to tailor the graphics pipeline to any given application. In exploration of this potential, we design and implement four novel pipeline modifications. Evaluation of the performance of our approach on more than 100 real-world scenes collected from video games shows rendering speeds within one order of magnitude of the hardware graphics pipeline as well as significant improvements over previous work, not only in terms of capabilities and performance, but also robustness.

431	GameSE_abstract	Design Patterns for NPC and Weapon Patterns in Shooters Game	We studied NPC and Weapon related issues in shooters game based on the design patterns in game design. Software engineering design patterns are explored to implements game design patterns that involves how NPCs are generated, behaviours and interact. We also studies using software design patterns to manage weapon's creation, varies weapon assembles issues based on weapon pattern. The reusability, maintainability, and quality of game development are supposed to improve and game development is able to adapt to evolutionary game building process. Although some design patterns are discussed, other design patterns might suitable as well because game programming are so complicated to separate each pattern independently.	video game; programming; design patterns; UML; object oriented programming; shooters game	Qu, J.

433	GameSE_abstract	Software Engineering For Automated Game Design	As we develop more assistive and automated game design systems, the question of how these systems should be integrated into game development workflows, and how much adaptation may be required, becomes increasingly important. In this paper we explore the impact of software engineering decisions on the ability of an automated game design system to understand a game's codebase, generate new game code, and evaluate its work. We argue that a new approach to software engineering may be required in order for game developers to fully benefit from automated game designers.

434	GameSE_abstract	Write-once,transpile-everywhere:Re-usingmotioncontrollersofvirtualhumansacrossmultiplegameengines|Signedin	Transpilation allows to write code once and re-use it across multiple runtime environments. In this paper, we propose a software development practice to implement once the motion controllers of virtual humans and re-use the implementation in multiple game engines. In a case study, three common human behaviors i? 1/2 blinking, text-to-speech, and eye-gaze i? 1/2 were developed in the Haxe programming language and deployed in the free, open-source Blender Game Engine and the commercial Unity engine. Performance tests show that transpiled code executes within 67% faster to 127% slower with respect to an implementation manually written in the game engine target languages.

435	GameSE_abstract	Continuous Experimentation in Mobile Game Development	Software companies need capabilities to evaluate the user value and the success of their products. This is especially crucial for highly competitive markets, such as the mobile game industry, where thousands of new games are introduced every month. Game companies often run continuous experiments as an integrated part of the overall development process. This paper presents a game company's journey on experimentation, and describes how the experiments are used at different stages of the development cycle to produce reliable, meaningful data for developers as well as how to balance between different data collection methods. Our study indicates that experiments are important in all stages of the development in different forms. Early stages in the development experiments can be run with proxy users due to lack of real users, whereas later in the development Key Performance Indicator (KPI) metrics play the most important role in experiments. Establishing concrete goals for the experiments, balancing between qualitative and quantitative data collection, experimentation throughout the development process with the guidance of an efficient leadership appears to be the key to success.

436	GameSE_abstract	Unlimited Rulebook: a Reference Architecture for Economy Mechanics in Digital Games	In game development, mechanics are one of the basis of the entertainment experience. However, the cost of implementing, improving, and refactoring economy mechanics is high because solutions cannot be easily reused across products. We argue that a reference architecture reduces this cost by providing knowledge reuse in addition to software reuse. To achieve that, we designed Unlimited Rulebook, a reference architecture for economy subsystems in games. It builds on established techniques such as Predicate Dispatching, the Entity-Component-System pattern, and the Adaptive Object-Model architectural style to facilitate the addition and modification of entity types and mechanics to the game while reducing the cost of changing existing code. We evaluated this cost reduction empirically via quasi-experiments with university students in two game programming courses.	reference architecture; design patterns; adaptive object-model; digital games; economy mechanics	Mizutani, Wilson Kazuo; Kon, Fabio	IEEE 17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE (ICSA 2020)	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSA47634.2020.00014		58-68		Included	Included	new_screen			2	Web of Science	2020	Unlimited Rulebook: A Reference Architecture For Economy Mechanics In Digital Games	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSA47634.2020.00014	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
437	GameSE_abstract	Software Architectures and the Creative Processes in Game Development	Game development is different from traditional software engineering in that there are no real functional requirements and the customers buy and use the software only because it is engaging and fun. This article investigates how game developers think about and use software architecture in the development of games. Further, it looks at how creative development processes are managed and supported. The results presented in this article come from responses to a questionnaire and a survey among thirteen game developers. The research questions answered in this study are: what role does the software architecture play in game development, how do game developers manage changes to the software architecture, how are creative development processes managed and supported, and how has game development evolved the last couple of years. Some of our findings are that software architectures play a central role in game development where the focus is mainly on achieving software with good performance and high modifiability, creative processes are supported through flexible game engines and tools, use of scripting and dynamic loading of assets, and feature-based teams with both creative and technical professions represented, and game developers are incrementally using more game-specific engines, tools and middleware in their development now compared to earlier.

439	GameSE_abstract	Analysis of linear sequential and extreme programming development methodology for a gaming application	There exist various software development methodologies under agile software development method. Extreme programming (XP) is known as one of the agile development methods that has gained popularity in the recent past. Waterfall model which is termed as linear sequential development model has been the traditional model of development. Both extreme programming and waterfall focus on different aspects during the process of software development and management. In this work we have analyzed the linear sequential software development methodology and the extreme programming method with regard to time constraints and risk mitigation. Our study shows that though there is no single methodology suited in all scenarios of development yet extreme programming gives fast delivery and less exposure to risks.

440	GameSE_abstract	Detecting Source Code Hotspot in Games Software Using Call Flow Analysis	In collaborative development of games software, hotspot identification technique significantly supports maintenance and evolutions activities including modding because newly involved developers must identify hotspot. This paper focuses on game loops as hotspots because many action games, including classic action games and the latest action games for console game machines, have an architecture consisting of game loops and update functions. This study assumes that game loops and update functions have the largest number of function calls in the entire source code modules. This paper investigates whether call flow analysis helps developers identify hotspots in four games software publicly accessible in GitHub. The results of the investigation revealed that one game loop and a set of update functions could be identified precisely by call flow analysis and that other three neighborhood functions could be identified. The results showed the possibility of automated identification of game loop and update functions by call flow analysis.	game loop; update functions; number of call flows; modding	Morisaki, Shoji; Kasai, Norimitsu; Kanamori, Koyo; Yamamoto, Shuichiro	2019 20TH IEEE/ACIS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, NETWORKING AND PARALLEL/DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING (SNPD)	https://doi.org/10.1109/snpd.2019.8935822		484-489		Included	Included	new_screen			2	Web of Science	2019	Detecting Source Code Hotspot In Games Software Using Call Flow Analysis	https://doi.org/10.1109/snpd.2019.8935822	IEEE	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
441	GameSE_abstract	A Systematic Mapping Study of MMOG Backend Architectures	The advent of utility computing has revolutionized almost every sector of traditional software development. Especially commercial cloud computing services, pioneered by the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft, have provided an unprecedented opportunity for the fast and sustainable development of complex distributed systems. Nevertheless, existing models and tools aim primarily for systems where resource usage-by humans and bots alike-is logically and physically quite disperse resulting in a low likelihood of conflicting resource access. However, a number of resource-intensive applications, such as Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) and large-scale simulations introduce a requirement for a very large common state with many actors accessing it simultaneously and thus a high likelihood of conflicting resource access. This paper presents a systematic mapping study of the state-of-the-art in software technology aiming explicitly to support the development of MMOGs, a class of large-scale, resource-intensive software systems. By examining the main focus of a diverse set of related publications, we identify a list of criteria that are important for MMOG development. Then, we categorize the selected studies based on the inferred criteria in order to compare their approach, unveil the challenges faced in each of them and reveal research trends that might be present. Finally we attempt to identify research directions which appear promising for enabling the use of standardized technology for this class of systems.	cloud computing; software architecture; Platform-as-a-Service; massively multiplayer online games	Kasenides, Nicos; Paspallis, Nearchos	INFORMATION	https://doi.org/10.3390/info10090264				Excluded	Excluded	new_screen		Not primary study: Non-primary studies.	2	Web of Science	2019	A Systematic Mapping Study Of Mmog Backend Architectures	https://doi.org/10.3390/info10090264	MDPIST ALBAN-ANLAGE	nan; References; Pages; Year; Bibtex; Link
442	GameSE_abstract	A Case Study on the Availability of Open-Source Components for Game Development	Nowadays the amount of source code that is freely available inside open-source software repositories offers great reuse opportunities to software developers. Therefore, it is expected that the implementation of several requirements can be facilitated by reusing open source software components. In this paper, we focus on the reuse opportunities that can be offered in one specific application domain, i.e., game development. In particular, we performed an embedded multiple case study on approximately 110 open-source games, exploiting a large-scale repository of OSS components, and investigated: (a) which game genres can benefit from open source reuse, and (b) what types of requirements can the available open-source components map to. The results of the case study suggest that: (a) game genres with complex game logic, e.g., First Person Shooter, Strategy, Role-Playing, and Sport games offer the most reuse opportunities, and (b) the most common requirement types that can be developed by reusing OSS components are related to scenarios and characters.

445	GameSE_abstract	Game Usability Heuristics (PLAY) for Evaluating and Designing Better Games: The Next Iteration	Game developers have begun applying formal human-computer interaction (HCI) principles in design. Desurvire et al [2] adapted a set of Heuristics for productivity software to games. The resulting set, presented at CHI 2004, was Heuristics to Evaluate Playability (HEP). Generalization of these heuristics is required to make them applicable to a multiple of game genres and game deliveries. This follow-up study focused on the refined list, Heuristics of Playability (PLAY), that can be applied earlier in game development as well as aiding developers between formal usability/playability research during the development cycle. Heuristics were formed based on their efficacious scores on the popular game review website, metacritic.com. Fifty-four gamers rated High and Low ranked games on 116 potential heuristics. Implications for how these Heuristics will help developers improve game quality are discussed. PLAY has been found useful in design evaluation and elf-report survey format.

446	GameSE_abstract	Heuristic usability evaluation on games: a modular approach	Heuristic evaluation is the preferred method to assess usability in games when experts conduct this evaluation. Many heuristics guidelines have been proposed attending to specificities of games but they only focus on specific subsets of games or platforms. In fact, to date the most used guideline to evaluate games usability is still Nielsen's proposal, which is focused on generic software. As a result, most evaluations do not cover important aspects in games such as mobility, multiplayer interactions, enjoyability and playability, etc. To promote the usage of new heuristics adapted to different game and platform aspects we propose a modular approach based on the classification of existing game heuristics using metadata and a tool, MUSE (Meta-heUristics uSability Evaluation tool) for games, which allows a rebuild of heuristic guidelines based on metadata selection in order to obtain a customized list for every real evaluation case. The usage of these new rebuilt heuristic guidelines allows an explicit attendance to a wide range of usability aspects in games and a better detection of usability issues. We preliminarily evaluate MUSE with an analysis of two different games, using both the Nielsen's heuristics and the customized heuristic lists generated by our tool.

447	GameSE_abstract	A Survey of Solutions for Game Engines in the Development of Immersive Applications for Multi-projection Systems as Base for a Generic Solution Design	Game engines are used in the development of virtual reality applications. They enable developers to focus the virtual environment and spend less time on its creation. The relationship between interactivity and graphics performance offered by game engines has led researchers to explore these engines in multi-projection systems based on the CAVE, which aims to provide an immersive experience through a wide field of view from multiple-screens, stereo images, and perspective correction based on the user's viewpoint. This paper surveys game engine solutions for the development of immersive applications for multi-projection systems in order to point out trends in the usage of these game creation tools for immersive systems and to identify a possible generic solution design.	virtual reality; game engine; multi-projection system	Popolin Neto, Mario; Ferreira Brega, Jose Remo	2015 XVII SYMPOSIUM ON VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY	https://doi.org/10.1109/SVR.2015.16		61-70		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen		Not primary study: Non-primary studies.	2	Web of Science	2015	A Survey Of Solutions For Game Engines In The Development Of Immersive Applications For Multi-Projection Systems As Base For A Generic Solution Design	https://doi.org/10.1109/SVR.2015.16	IEEE	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

449	GameSE_abstract	Generic evaluation framework for games development methodology	In general the evaluation phase serves as a catalyst in software development and particularly within games development. Hence, it plays a vital role in the formulation of an effective a game development methodology. This paper has investigated the evaluation phase and has focused on the provision of general heuristics sets to facilitate the evaluation process. A generic evaluation framework has been defined as an output of this paper which could be used in the majority of game genres, and therefore it can be an important part of generic game development methodology. Furthermore, this evaluation process has been repeated in each iteration of the game development methodology. The results from each iteration should be compared with previous iteration to enhance and improve games before the final game release.

451	GameSE_abstract	Defining an Iterative ISO/IEC 29110 Deployment Package for Game Developers	Software development in a small development team is a challenge, as people have to fulfill several roles, which in larger groups would have dedicated people. To help in this aspect, the ISO/IEC 29110 Lifecycle profiles for Very Small Entities has been developed to help organization and manage the workflow. However, the model presented in the ISO/IEC 29110 is rather abstract, and prominently follows the waterfall approach, even though the documents do amend agile practices as one acceptable approach. In game development this loosely defined approach is problematic, since games industry heavily relies in the agile practices with short cycles of iterations. In this article, the authors present their study of game development organizations, and describe the ISO/IEC 29110 deployment package i? 1/2Highly Iterative Software Processesi? 1/2 which combines the Entry level model with the industry-specific requirements. In general, the definition of support for the iterative development makes the model feasible for the industry.	nan	Kasurinen, Jussi; Smolander, Kari	International Journal of Information Technologies and Systems Approach	https://www.igi-global.com/article/defining-an-iterative-isoiec-29110-deployment-package-for-game-developers/169770	nan	19	nan	Included	Included	new_screen			2	GoogleScholar	2017	Defining An Iterative Iso/Iec 29110 Deployment Package For Game Developers	https://www.igi-global.com/article/defining-an-iterative-isoiec-29110-deployment-package-for-game-developers/169770	IGI Global	
452	GameSE_abstract	Empirical analysis of user data in game software development	For several years empirical studies have spanned the spectrum of research from software productivity, quality, reliability, performance to human computer interaction. Analyses have involved software systems ranging from desktop software to telecommunication switching systems. But surprising there has been little work done on the emerging digital game industry, one of the fastest growing domains today. To the best of our knowledge, our work is one of the first empirical analysis of a large commercially successful game system. In this paper, we introduce an analysis of the significant user data generated in the gaming industry by using a successful game: Project Gotham Racing 4.More specifically, due to the increasing ubiquity of constantly connected high-speed internet connections for game consoles, developers are able to collect extensive amounts of data about their games following release. The challenge now is to make sense of that data, and from it be able to make recommendations to developers. This paper presents an empirical case study analyzing the data collected from a released game over a three year period. The results of this analysis include a better understanding of the differences between long-term and short-term players, and the extent to which various options in the game are utilized. This led to recommendations for future development ways to reduce development costs and to keep new players engaged. A secondary goal for this paper is to introduce software game development as a topic of importance to the empirical software engineering community and discuss research results on a key difference area: data analytics on user data to customize user and development experiences.	game metrics;  game development;  game design	Hullett, Kenneth; Nagappan, Nachiappan; Schuh, Eric; Hopson, John	ESEM '12: Proceedings of the ACM-IEEE international symposium on Empirical software engineering and measurement	https://doi.org/10.1145/2372251.2372265		89-98	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2372251.2372265,

453	GameSE_abstract	Toward a framework for prototyping physical interfaces in multiplayer gaming: TwinSpace experiences	We reflect on our experiences using an experimental platform for rapidly prototyping physical control configurations for multiplayer games. We describe how the architecture permits novel forms of collaborative play through the combination and configuration of basic tangible/physical building blocks, the deep integration between physical and virtual objects, and flexibility in how physical and virtual spaces are mapped onto each other. We also identify three important limitations of the architecture that became apparent through our prototyping efforts.

454	GameSE_abstract	Play-testing and Requirements Engineering: Implications for Research and Teaching	In Requirements Engineering (RE) for large scale game systems, play-testing is an important activity that is used to validate requirements from players' perspective. Play-testers are not professionals that are involved in the process of RE. They are not professional testers, either. Yet, their feedback in terms of perceptions and experiences of the early prototypes of a game, have a decisive impact on what the RE-professionals do next in the RE process. This position paper presents a qualitative study that sought to discover who takes the role of play-testers and what kind of feedback play-testers generate in the early stages of RE for games. The case study responds to the observation that no textbook on RE or software engineering addresses play-testing as a phenomenon, and that classic Computer Science programs at universities teach testing techniques mostly in the context of embedded systems, hence students often are left with little opportunity to develop testing skills that build upon play-testing practices happening in the game development sector. The study therefore was aimed at identifying important implications that play-testing may have for research and teaching.

455	GameSE_abstract	On-Demand Automated Traceability Maintenance and Evolution	After the painstaking process of traceability construction, a substantial evolution of a software system, such as a new major version leads to the decay of traceability links. To date, however, none of the published studies have considered the on-demand update of traceability links. This paper presents an on-demand automated approach for case-based maintenance and evolution of traceability links in the context of different versions of a software project. The approach focuses on the component-to-component features for identification and prioritization of previous traceability cases, which are then used to perform reuse and adaptation of traceability links based on the matches and mismatches, respectively. The adapted (i.e., newly constructed) traceability links can then be verified by a human analyst and stored in a case base. The approach has been validated using an open-source framework for mobile games, named Soomla Android store.		Javed, Muhammad Atif; Muram, Faiz U.

456	GameSE_abstract	An Experimental Study on Robustness and Responsiveness Testing of Iranian Android Games	During the last decade, many Iranian software and game developers have targeted Android as their main development framework, resulting in the availability of a large number of Android applications. Despite the opportunities that Android provides for application developers, it introduces new challenges for the development of high quality applications. In this paper, we have focused on responsiveness and fault-tolerance as two interesting quality attributes of Android applications, lack of which might result in users' dissatisfaction and leaving the application. Hence, we have conducted an experimental study, using monkey testing technique, on a set of Iranian Android games to assess their robustness and responsiveness. The results demonstrate that much more attention needs to be paid by Iranian Android developers to the responsiveness and fault-tolerance of their applications, since about 85% of the analyzed games have shown to have at least one responsiveness or robustness error.

457	GameSE_abstract	Linking Rules and Conceptual Model in a Domain Specific Language	The rationale behind domain specific modeling in software engineering is to raise the level of abstraction while boosting automation in software production. Domain-specific languages (DSLs) typically fall into two categories: high-level, script-like languages and visual modeling languages. The code generation engines that come with them are capable of translating what is written (or visually expressed) to executable code. Our goal is to build a DSL for software development that integrates script-like languages into conceptual models, which is analogous to the way the Object Constraint Language (OCL) puts more semantics in UML models (but ours is essentially at a higher level of abstract than OCL/UML). We identify the following problems for such a DSL: i) conceptual models do not adequately capture the logic of games; ii) keeping conceptual models and rules in synch; iii) defining a rule description language that is powerful enough to decoratively capture most game logic and at the same time facilitate the automation, i.e allows a DSL engine to generate executable code. In this paper, we present our DSL that addresses these three problems. We propose a high-level declarative language for capturing rules. We also describe the prototypes we have built for our DSL in this paper.

458	GameSE_abstract	An automated model based testing approach for platform games	Game development has recently gained a lot of momentum and is now a major software development industry. Platform games are being revived with both their 2D and 3D versions being developed. A major challenge faced by the industry is a lack of automated system-level approaches for game testing. Currently in most game development organizations, games are tested manually or using semi-automated techniques. Such testing techniques do not scale to the industry requirements where more systematic and repeatable approaches are required. In this paper we propose a model-based testing approach for automated black box functional testing of platform games. The paper provides a detailed modeling methodology to support automated system-level game testing. As part of the methodology, we provide guidelines for modeling the platform games for testing using our proposed game test modeling profile. We use domain modeling for representing the game structure and UML state machines for behavioral modeling. We present the details related to automated test case generation, execution, and oracle generation. We demonstrate our model-based testing approach by applying it on two cases studies, a widely referenced and open source implementation of Mario brothers game and an industrial case study of an endless runner game. The proposed approach was able to identify major faults in the open source game implementation. Our results showed that the proposed approach is practical and can be applied successfully on industrial games.	black box testing;  functional testing;  game testing;  model based testing (MBT);  system-level testing and unified modeling language (UML)	Iftikhar, Sidra; Iqbal, Muhammad Zohaib; Khan, Muhammad Uzair; Mahmood, Wardah	MODELS '15: Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems	https://doi.org/10.5555/3351736.3351787		426-435	"@inproceedings{10.5555/3351736.3351787,

459	GameSE_abstract	GE526: A Dataset of Open-Source Game Engines	Game engines, are frameworks that provide a platform for developers to build games with an interface tailored to handle the complexity of game development. Though there is extensive empirical research on software frameworks, there is a need for empirical studies on game engines, as they differ from traditional software frameworks. Thus, to aid research and development in the area of game engines, we present GE526, a curated dataset of 526 game engine repositories mined from GitHub, which can help researchers to analyze game engines in terms of the release cycles, code quality, API usability and so on. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any curated dataset that caters to game engines in the literature. The dataset contains metadata of all the mined repositories, including 582,079 commits, 20,138 pull requests, 30,287 issues reports and 2,111 releases. The dataset along with its documentation is made available at - https://bit.ly/3pyexnc.

460	GameSE_abstract	Mobile game testing: Case study of a puzzle game genre	The advancement of mobile technologies allows developers to build more sophisticated application specifically mobile game. As the result, mobile game has more complex gameplays and incorporates more complex resources, such as 2D images, 3D objects, artificial intelligence, sounds, and many more. Developers are spoilt by the vast number of available game engines that enable rapid mobile game development. However, the mobile game source codes that orchestrate all the interconnected resources are also getting large in the size and eventually leading to difficulties in tracing bugs in the codes. Meanwhile, software testing is still a growing area that, despite vary proposed techniques to identify errors in source code have been developed, yet it has to consider more studies in mobile game category. This research aims to conduct an appropriate testing on a mobile game application. We choose to test an awards-winning mobile game using an available testing tool, named Unity Test Tool. The tool is explored during this study and then applied to test the game that of puzzle genre. At the end of the study, the research finds that the game is faults/bugs-free.

465	GameSE_abstract	Improving the process for mobile games development	People have been using mobile phones since the last two decades. To a certain extent, these mobile phones have replaced the traditional computational devices and some people even prefer to use mobile phones for their daily tasks and entertainment. Games are a good source of entertainment and mobile games provide the opportunity for enjoyment on the go. Development of these mobile games, however, is not easy. It is very much different from the development of traditional software applications. Therefore, it is essential to follow a well-defined process in order to build quality mobile games that keep endusers engaged and satisfied. In this research, the existing process for developing mobile games is identified and a new process is derived using feedback from the industry. Results of a controlled industrial experiment indicate that the new process produces a better quality mobile game.

468	GameSE_abstract	Publish/subscribe assisted neuroevolution in virtual life game	Simple Event Relaying Framework (SERF) is a software framework that attempts to bring lightweight publish/subscribe architecture inside individual devices and processes. In this paper we study the performance of SERF when it is used as a base for studying a different topic: virtual creatures in a life game learning to seek food via evolutionary algorithms. We measure the time spent on the whole evolution as compared to the time spent on routing events in different network configurations. Results indicate that SERF has small enough overhead to be used even for messaging within the same application while still enabling the benefits of loose coupling.

470	GameSE_abstract	Playing the Sprint Retrospective: A Replication Study	The Sprint Retrospective is a vehicle for continuous process improvement. Even though it is a well established agile practice, running effective retrospective meetings is challenging. There have been a lot of identified problems that commonly occur during these meetings. To address them, Przybylek & Kotecka [20] successfully revitalized retrospective meetings by adopting collaborative games, which represent a powerful tool in improving interactions among team members. In this paper, we report on a replication of their study in Bluebay Poland and IHS Markit Gdansk. The received feedback confirms the original findings and indicates that game-based retrospectives improve team members' creativity, involvement, and communication as well as produce better results than the standard retrospectives.

471	GameSE_abstract	Selective Event Processing for Energy Efficient Mobile Gaming with SNIP	Gaming is an important class of workloads for mobile devices. They are not only one of the biggest markets for game developers and app stores, but also amongst the most stressful applications for the SoC. In these workloads, much of the computation is user-driven, i.e. events captured from sensors drive the computation to be performed. Consequently, event processing constitutes the bulk of energy drain for these applications. To address this problem, we conduct a detailed characterization of event processing activities in several popular games and show that (i) some of the events are exactly repetitive in their inputs, not requiring any processing at all; or (ii) a significant number of events are redundant in that even if the inputs for these events are different, the output matches events already processed. Memoization is one of the obvious choices to optimize such behavior, however the problem is a lot more challenging in this context because the computation can span even functional/OS boundaries, and the input space required for tables can takes gigabytes of storage. Instead, our Selecting Necessary InPuts (SNIP) software solution uses machine learning to isolate the input features that we really need to track in order to considerably shrink memoization tables. We show that SNIP can save up to 32% of the energy in these games without requiring any hardware modifications.

472	GameSE_abstract	Function Points Method in Game Casual Context	Function Points (FP) method has been trusty and proven to be effective to estimate the effort of thousands of software development projects. Nowadays, the mobile game development-especially in a casual genre-is growing. Therefore, the researcher is excited to test the FP method whether it can also be applied to estimating the game development effort. FP method usually consists of 3 main stages: weighing 5 parameters of Unadjusted FP, calculating 14 complexity factors, and calculating Adjusted FP. Survey to 8 casual games was conducted and the value of effort for each one of them has been estimated. So, we conclude that FP is not suitable to forecast the effort of mobile casual games. There are 376 percent deviation between effort estimations and actual effort. The authors suspect, for mobile game development, the game's point of view needs to be re-adjusted to 5 input parameters, complexity factors, conversion of programming languages, and productivity rate.

473	GameSE_abstract	Generating Automated Rules-Based Game Design Prototypes with MaruGen	Of all of the aspects of game development, Game Design is a long, complicated process that can only be solved via trial and error. Although Game Design can be understood with simple rulesets that define basic game mechanics, it can become a complex problem when many different rules get involved. Moreover, coming up with innovations in this field can be a daunting creative task. Other fields of game development like content creation and procedural generation have created automated tools to facilitate process, but this has not yet been materialized for basic Game Design and prototyping. MaruGen (Machinations Ruleset Generator) is a procedural L-System based tool that aims to fill this gap by creating complex rule-sets from a formal grammar, based on proved simple ones, in an attempt to automate design and encourage innovation via the emergent nature of the rulesets themselves.

474	GameSE_abstract	Heuristic Based Approach for Usability Evaluation of Mobile Games	The increasing popularity of mobile games has grasped the attention in both academia and industry. The game market has evolved to the extent that it has great impact in the economy of the worlds. As there are multiple areas of issues that affect the game quality, but game usability is one of the major problems that game designers are facing. Heuristic evaluation has been very popular method. But the lack of validation has weakened the effectiveness and confidence in the heuristics. This paper focuses on the issues related to usability of the mobile games. A survey was conducted to identify the issues of usability in a game directly from the game players. This survey covered one major genre of games. After identification and analysis, we proposed a new set of heuristics to enhance the usability of mobile games. We have also used these heuristics as guidelines to redesign a game. And the redesigned game has been evaluated by the players to validate our newly proposed heuristics. By validation of heuristics we can certainly increase the usability.	design; usability; heuristics; mobile games; validation of heuristics	Robson, Raheel Shehzad; Sabahat, Nosheen	2020 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING, ELECTRONICS & COMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING (ICCECE	https://doi.org/10.1109/iccece49321.2020.9231175		156-161		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen		Not related to Video Games: Studies that were not focused on software engineering applied to industry-scale computer games development.	2	Web of Science	2020	Heuristic Based Approach For Usability Evaluation Of Mobile Games	https://doi.org/10.1109/iccece49321.2020.9231175	IEEE	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
475	GameSE_abstract	Shader components: modular and high performance shader development	Modern game engines seek to balance the conflicting goals of high rendering performance and productive software development. To improve CPU performance, the most recent generation of real-time graphics APIs provide new primitives for performing efficient batch updates to shader parameters. However, modern game engines featuring large shader codebases have struggled to take advantage of these benefits. The problem is that even though shader parameters can be organized into efficient modules bound to the pipeline at various frequencies, modern shading languages lack corresponding primitives to organize shader logic (requiring these parameters) into modules as well. The result is that complex shaders are typically compiled to use a monolithic block of parameters, defeating the design, and performance benefits, of the new parameter binding API. In this paper we propose to resolve this mismatch by introducing shader components, a first-class unit of modularity in a shader program that encapsulates a unit of shader logic and the parameters that must be bound when that logic is in use. We show that by building sophisticated shaders out of components, we can retain essential aspects of performance (static specialization of the shader logic in use and efficient update of parameters at component granularity) while maintaining the modular shader code structure that is desirable in today's high-end game engines.	shading languages;  real-time rendering	He, Yong; Foley, Tim; Hofstee, Teguh; Long, Haomin; Fatahalian, Kayvon	ACM Trans.

476	GameSE_abstract	Measuring Quality of Mobile Games from Player Perspective and Network Conditions	Mobile Games can be defined as games performed on handheld devices with network functionality. The two key elements of this definition are portability and networking capabilities. In this definition, mobile games are usually referred to as games that are played on mobile devices such as mobile phones and PDAs with wireless communication function. Developer needs something to assess the quality of mobile games. In this study we proposed a measurement quality of mobile games from player perspective and network condition. It means, we collaborate 2 models to measure the quality of mobile games. That models are quality model based on ISO 25000 standard and Game Rating Factor (GRF). Our quality model can assess the quality of the game in terms of the player's needs and the needs of the network.

477	GameSE_abstract	A method to assess pervasive qualities in mobile games	Software designers are facing huge challenges imposed by a new generation of applications that mix real and digital worlds, such as pervasive games. This type of game has recently become a worldwide phenomenon, with thousands of people walking in the streets with smartphones to interact with the physical environment. In this paper, we propose a new method to assess pervasive qualities in pervasive mobile games, which can be customized and extended to other ubiquitous applications. This method generates a quality report, which consists of a quality spreadsheet (containing metric values and comments) and a quality vector (representing the game quality profile in the form of a bar chart). In addition, we can compare quality vectors using similarity criteria. In this paper, we apply the proposed method to commercial and academic prototype games to shed more light on their pervasive characteristics and identify ways to improve the overall quality that sets these games apart from traditional digital games-that is, pervasiveness.

478	GameSE_abstract	Supporting the design of location-based experiences by creative individuals	This paper discusses the creative practice of independents and individuals and their requirements for tools to author location-based experiences (LBE), including location-based games (LBG). The work describes and presents initial findings from a questionnaire study and a workshop. Both studies focused upon the working practices of individuals and small independent artists, hackers and researchers, rather than designers or developers in large commercial companies or small to medium sized enterprises. A qualitative analysis of findings from the studies were used to inform user requirements and design of next-generation authoring tools through a process of co-design. It was identified that creative individuals typically used a complex and wide-ranging set of design and development tools. These often varied for each project, and were sometimes bespoke. Requirements for future creative design tools could be grouped into higher levels categories to support: flexibility and extendability of authoring tools; in-situ authoring and the seamless transition between desktop and mobile locations; improved positioning; and authoring beyond maps.

479	GameSE_abstract	Tailoring Agent Platforms with Software Product Lines	Agent platforms have been conceived traditionally as middleware, helping to deal with various application challenges like agent programming models, remote messaging, and coordination protocols. A middleware is typically a bundle of functionalities necessary to execute multi-agent applications. In contrast to this traditional view, nowadays different use cases also for selected agent concepts have emerged requiring also different kinds of functionalities. Examples include a platform for conducting multi-agent simulations, intelligent agent behavior models for controlling non-player characters (NPCs) in games and a lightweight version suited for mobile devices. A one-size-fits-all software bundle often does not sufficiently match these requirements, because customers and developers want solutions specifically tailored to their needs, i.e. a small but focused solution is frequently preferred over bloated software with extraneous functionality. Software product lines are an approach suitable for creating a series of similar products from a common code base. In this paper we will show how software product line modeling and technology can help creating tailor-made products from multi-agent platforms. Concretely, the Jadex platform will be analyzed and a feature model as well as an implementation path will be presented.

Then an online control algorithm for the architecture is proposed to produce joint improvised motion with a human player or another virtual player while exhibiting some desired kinematic characteristics. Finally, the transition from solo motions to joint improvised motions is illuminated, and the proposed control architecture is validated by matching the experimental data.

481	GameSE_abstract	Monkey Gamer: Automatic Profiling of Android Games	Creation of smartphone applications has undergone a massive explosion in recent years and there is an urgent need for evaluation of their resource efficiency, trustworthiness and reliability. A large proportion of these apps are going to be within the gaming area. In this paper we classify game apps on the basis of their development process, their I/O process and their interaction level. We present Monkey Gamer, a software to automatically play a large class of Android games and collect execution traces, based on a state machine to partially describe the game structure and interactions. A significant similarity is shown when comparing the results obtained by the Monkey Gamer and by human players, for three of the most popular Android games. We evaluate the performance of the Monkey Gamer by comparing the traces it generates with traces created when humans play the games, and find significant similarity in the trace sets.

482	GameSE_abstract	Predict the Storm: A simulation model to measure the playability before the game development	Design and development of multi-player network games is a complex and involved process. Apart from standard software development complexity, the game designer has to carefully think about issues like playability, user experience and scalability aspects of the game during the design phase itself. Most of the existing methodologies to determine playability of a multi-player game with a targeted user experience level are only applied after the game is developed. This is highly undesirable as it incurs a high cost because multiple design and development cycles are involved that take time and increase development complexity. We propose a simulation technique that can be used to validate the playability of a game in terms of quality of experience of end-users prior to full game development. The simulation output can also provide some guidelines to the resource planning of the game server with respect to targeted requirements for user experience. Our goal in developing this tool is to make it generic and versatile at the same time staying reasonably true to the real game strategy so that it is useful for the game designers to quickly run a simulation to get insight about the game playability before the actual development process.

483	GameSE_abstract	Design and Implementation of a Reconfigurable Mobile Game Controller on Smartphone	Expansion of games industry came in modern life, accompanied with innovative features in a game controller. Nowadays mobile industry is booming with the expansion of the variety of novel technologies, such as the use of 3D accelerometer sensors, high resolution cameras, the capability of connecting to wireless networks and so on. Therefore, a smartphone can be added with the game control functions to become a mobile game controller. In this paper, we propose the design and implementation of making a mobile phone as a game controller using User Datagram Protocol socket programming. This system is developed by Java 2 Standard Edition and Google Android Software Development Kits which has already provided sensor and multi-touch APIs. We successfully realize a reconfigurable mobile game controller on a mobile smartphone to interact with the existing digital games by mapping control functions on the server. Acceptable performance is shown to validate the effectiveness of our solution.

484	GameSE_abstract	Discovering Agent Behaviors Through Code Reuse: Examples From Half-Field Offense and Ms. Pac-Man	This paper demonstrates how code reuse allows genetic programming (GP) to discover strategies for difficult gaming scenarios while maintaining relatively low model complexity. Critical factors in the proposed approach are illustrated through an in-depth study in two challenging task domains: RoboCup soccer and Ms. Pac-Man. In RoboCup, we demonstrate how policies initially evolved for simple subtasks can be reused, with no additional training or transfer function, in order to improve learning in the complex half-field offense (HFO) task. We then show how the same approach to code reuse can be applied directly in Ms. Pac-Man. In the latter case, the use of task-agnostic diversity maintenance removes the need to explicitly identify suitable subtasks a priori. The resulting GP policies achieve state-of-the-art levels of play in HFO and surpass scores previously reported in the Ms. Pac-Man literature, while employing less domain knowledge during training. Moreover, the highly modular policies discovered by GP are shown to be significantly less complex than state-of-the-art solutions in both domains. Throughout this paper, we pay special attention to a pair of task-agnostic diversity maintenance techniques, and empirically demonstrate their importance to the development of strong policies.

486	GameSE_abstract	Declarative procedural generation of architecture with semantic architectural profiles	Procedural content generation (PCG) for architecture is widely used in a variety of digital media, most notably in games. However, such methods are often limited in their expressive range, and require considerable technical knowledge to create non-trivial architectural structures. We present a novel tile-based PCG approach for generating architecture, that proposes the use of architectural profiles, a declarative characterization of architectural typology, within a generic tile solving framework. An architectural profile consists of a set of tiles, representing atomic architectural building blocks, and a set of declarative constraints and rules, specifying which conditions a tile configuration has to satisfy to be valid. These conditions are translated into logic constraints, and used by a tile solver to control tile placement in a bottom-up manner. Eventually, each valid model output by the solver is a representative instance of its architectural profile. We describe an implementation of this approach with Answer Set Programming, using an off-the-shelf constraint solver for model generation. We performed an expressive range analysis, and concluded that our declarative method is quite controllable and can be steered over a broad range of architectural structures, regarding density and repetitiveness. Due to this expressive range and control, our tile-based method is very suitable for the customized development of urban environments for games.

488	GameSE_abstract	Architecture Considerations for Spaced Repetition Based Mobile Learning Games on iOS	When programs get big enough to be called software, they need an architecture. An architecture helps organizing a software's structure so that it is easier to maintain and so that parts of it can be re-used in similar circumstances. When spaced repetition based mobile learning is concerned, re-use is crucial. Spaced repetition learning is an approach that schedules presentation of learning content based on psychological models. Paired with learning games, it can be used to control the flow of the game so that learning content is presented in the most efficient manner. In order to achieve this, the game and the spaced repetition model have to act in a highly interleaved manner. However, the spaced repetition model remains the same, regardless of the game at hand. A useful architecture would design interaction between the spaced repetition model and a game so that developers can focus on the game part and use a minimal interface to turn a simple learning game into a spaced repetition learning game. As space repetition relies on calculated presentation intervals, mobile devices are an optimal platform since they allow for learning anytime. However, mobile devices come with unique constraints that have to be considered when conceiving an architecture. This paper discusses possible software architectures for spaced repetition learning games on the iOS platform as well as architecturally relevant details of spaced repetition learning.	game based learning; mobile learning; spaced repetition; SuperMemo; learning game architecture	Schimanke, Florian; Mertens, Robert; Vornberger, Oliver	2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MULTIMEDIA (ISM)	https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2014.17		363-368		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen		Serious games or gamification: Studies that were focused on the social and educational impact of video games, such as serious games.	2	Web of Science	2014	Architecture Considerations For Spaced Repetition Based Mobile Learning Games On Ios	https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2014.17	IEEE	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

Game designers and software engineers usually live on opposite sides of the fence, and both lose time when adjustments best understood by designers are implemented by engineers. Designers lack a common vocabulary for expressing gameplay, which hampers specification, communication and agreement. We aim to speed up the game development process by improving designer productivity and design quality. The language Machinations has introduced a graphical notation for expressing the rules of game economies that is close to a designer's vocabulary. We present the language Micro- Machinations (MM) that details and formalizes the meaning of a significant subset of Machination's language features and adds several new features most notably modularization. Next we describe MM Analysis in Rascal (MM AiR), a framework for analysis and simulation of MM models using the Rascal meta-programming language and the Spin model checker. Our approach shows that it is feasible to rapidly simulate game economies in early development stages and to separate concerns. Today's meta-programming technology is a crucial enabler to achieve this.

490	GameSE_abstract	A model and software architecture for MMORPG traffic generation based on player behavior	In this paper we present a software architecture for traffic generation based on application level player behavior in Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs). We have performed measurements of network traffic for each of the previously defined action categories for MMORPGs (Trading, Questing, Dungeons, Raiding, Player versus Player Combat, and Uncategorized), as well as measurements of application level player behavior in terms of listed action categories. Based on the obtained datasets we have created network traffic models for each action category and player behavior models with focus on hourly and daily trends. Network traffic models are implemented in Distributed Internet Traffic Generator and verified through comparison with the real traffic. Player behavior models explore number of active players, session duration, as well as lengths and probability of session segments (i.e., parts of the session consisting of only one category of player actions). We propose an architecture which enables scalable, behavior-driven traffic generation and implement it in a laboratory testbed. In order to achieve scalability of the system, we use Linux Containers as a virtualization technique. The resulting implementation can generate hundreds of MMORPG streams on a single PC. As a case study we used Activision Blizzard's World of Warcraft.

491	GameSE_abstract	An Approach of Real-Time Team Behavior Control in Games	The design of NPC(Non-Player Character) is an analytic process. It is relying on assumptions of human game players' behavior. In practice, however, different PCs(Player Characters) often exhibit variable behavior, making them difficult to predicate and complicating the design process. In this paper, we describe an approach for team AI planning and learning. This approach is based on procedural knowledge and a layered multi-agent architecture. We implement real-time transfer learning and adaptive mechanism for the team of NPCs. The team can react to the human player with the tactical awareness of seasoned team behavior. Results indicate that the approach of using the hybrid of transfer learning and adaptive mechanism can improve NPCs' overall performance in real-time.

492	GameSE_abstract	The Cardboard VR Game Development Tool	Due to the technological development of the head-mounted device, the user can experience the world of virtual reality, and the immersive experience combined with the gameplay of the game can provide a new experience for the player. Google Cardboard is cheap and easy to use, providing a simpler method to experience VR games. Cardboard VR games make game design more difficult due to the functional limitations of the device, so there are few related games. However, it is easier to play such games. Designing a good game will have good market value. When students make this kind of hard - to - design game, if their pressure on programming can be reduced, students can focus on game design to design better ones.

493	GameSE_abstract	Defining usability quality metric for mobile game prototype using software attributes	The rapid growth in the development of mobile games to serve various user needs has result in a high competition of software game development industry. Usability is a major quality of mobile game product which significantly affects the player satisfaction. The usability assessment of mobile game product which is game prototype developed during the production is result from the need of correction in an earlier stage which may help reduction in cost and time development. This research proposes an approach to define an internal usability quality metric for a mobile game prototype developed in a design phase. The proposed metric, classified from software attributes as content, device, and gameplay is defined based on the general suggested usability metric category in ISO/IEC 9126-3 standard and derived from GQM method (Goal Question Metrics). The structure and elements of the metric description are established from the ISO/IEC 15939 standard.

494	GameSE_abstract	Revisiting design guidelines for pervasive games	Purpose: Existing guidelines are typically extracted from a few empirical evaluations of pervasive game prototypes featuring incompatible scenarios, game play design and technical characteristics. Hence, the applicability of those design guidelines across the increasingly diverse landscape of pervasive games is questionable and should be investigated. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents Barbarossa, a scenario-driven pervasive game that encompasses different game modes, purposely adopting opposing principles in addressing the core elements of challenge and control. Using Barbarossa as a testbed, this study aims at validating the applicability of existing design guidelines across diverse game design approaches. Findings: The compilation of Barbarossa user evaluation results confirmed the limited applicability of existing guidelines and provided evidence that developers should handle core game elements, taking into account the game play characteristics derived from their scenario. Originality/value: Stepping upon those findings, the authors propose a revision of design guidelines relevant to control and challenge based on elaborate classification criteria for pervasive game prototypes.

495	GameSE_abstract	POGGI: Puzzle-based online games on grid infrastructures	Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) currently entertain millions of players daily. To keep these players online and generate revenue, MMOGs are currently relying on manually generated content such as logical challenges (puzzles). Under increased demands for personalized content from a growing community, it has become attractive to generate personalized puzzle game content automatically. In this work we investigate the automated puzzle game content generation for MMOGs on grid infrastructures. First, we characterize the requirements of this novel grid application. With long-term real traces taken from a popular MMOG we show that hundreds of thousands of players are simultaneously online during peak periods, which makes content generation a large-scale compute-intensive problem. Second, we design the POGGI architecture to support this type of application. We assess the performance of our reference implementation in a real environment by running over 200,000 tasks in a pool of over 1,600 nodes, and demonstrate that POGGI can generate commercial-quality content efficiently and robustly.

496	GameSE_abstract	The role of Sprint planning and feedback in game development projects: Implications for game quality	Game development projects adopt Scrum to leverage their flexibility, as game concepts and the customer preferences are highly abstract and unpredictable. The most desirable features in an original game will not be easily identified during the first phase of development but will emerge later in a clear pattern as developers and testers continuously play test the game. Thus, game development projects use feedback from game testers to understand what they think of various features and concepts, to obtain a better understanding of problem spaces. This study proposes that game tester feedback moderates the effect of Sprint planning on game quality. A field study was conducted using a pair-matched questionnaire in which 102 game development projects participated. Results showed that Sprint planning has a positive effect on game quality. The results also revealed that iterative feedback has a moderating effect on the relationship between Sprint planning and game quality. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

497	GameSE_abstract	Multi-user Gaming on the Grid Using a Service Oriented HLA RTI	Interactive multi-user Internet games require frequent state updates between players to accommodate the great demand for reality and interactivity. The large latency and limited bandwidth on the Internet greatly affects the game's scalability. The High Level Architecture (HLA) is the IEEE standard for distributed simulation with its Data Distribution Management (DDM) service group assuming the functionalities of interest management. With its support for reuse and interoperability and its DDM support for communication optimization, the HLA is promising at supporting multi-user gaming on the Internet. However, this usually requires particular prior security setup across administrative domains according to the specific Run Time Infrastructure (RTI) used. We have previously developed a Service Oriented HLA RTI (SOHR) which enables distributed simulations to be conducted across administrated domains on the Grid. This paper discusses multi-user gaming on the Grid using SOHR. Specifically, a maze game is used to illustrate how SOHR enables users to join a game conveniently. Experiments have been carried out to show how DDM can improve the communication efficiency.

498	GameSE_abstract	Celeris Base: An interactive and immersive Boussinesq-type nearshore wave simulation software	We introduce our interactive and immersive coastal wave simulation software, Celeris Base, which is the successor to Celeris Advent. Celeris Base is an open source software developed in the Unity3D game engine and in C# language. It supports an interactive environment and allows users to view the simulations in a virtual reality headset. Celeris Base solves the same equations as Celeris Advent, the extended Boussinesq equations, using our hybrid finite volume-finite difference method. These equations are solved on the GPU using compute shaders, written in HLSL. Celeris Base has several new features such as 360 degrees video capturing, geographic map overlays, built-in real-time gauge plotters, etc. It also improves the implementation of the sponge layer boundary condition by introducing new damping equations. Celeris Base is designed and implemented using the best software engineering practices in the hope that it will be a base for further developments of the Celeris software series by researchers around the globe. We validate Celeris Base against experimental results in this paper.Program summaryProgram Title: Celeris BaseProgram Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/jdx7tddcxz.1Licensing provisions: MIT LicenseProgramming language: C#, HLSLNature of problem: Celeris Advent enabled researchers and engineers for the first time to simulate nearshore waves with a Boussinesq-type model, faster than real-time and in an interactive environment. However, its development platform and implementation complexity hindered researchers from developing it further and made adding new features to the software a daunting task. The software used graphics shaders to solve scientific equations which could be confusing for many. The visualization environment was wired from scratch which made it very difficult to add features such as virtual reality.Solution method: A new software is developed completely from scratch following Celeris Advent, called Celeris Base. This software uses the same hybrid finite volume-finite difference scheme to solve the extended Boussinesq equations, but using a variant of shaders called compute shaders, removing possible barriers for other researchers to understand the code and develop it further. The software is developed in Unity3D, a popular game engine with a large and helpful community as well as thousands of ready to use plugins. Celeris Base is equipped with virtual reality and is the first nearshore simulation software to provide this feature.

499	GameSE_abstract	Closed Room Fire Propagation Modelling Using Multiple State Variables Cellular Automata	The modelling of fire propagation is an interesting yet challenging study, nevertheless it is often discussed in many literatures. Fire is a natural phenomenon that occurs in our daily lives, its fiery and igniting characteristics which contributes to burning effect have important roles in many cases. From a mere visual effect to key event on main storytelling. The importance of fire and how it is spread on daily lives influence game developing process where a fire can start and spread, causing destruction. Fire has a spread pattern that can be based on the material it is igniting and how long the fire has been flaming since the hotspot first occurs. With correct implication, the pattern of fire propagation can be simulated and applied to a game to contribute to realism and immersion aspect of any games. Cellular Automata is based on a principle where a region or area is divided into two dimensional cells where every cells have unique attributes. Every cells can influence other cells given the cells are neighbors to each other. This principle is comparable to thermodynamics where heat or in this case, fire, can only spread to an area next to the ember. Given the Health Point on every cells, a fire simulation can be build and modified accordingly.

500	GameSE_abstract	Balancing game universes for playing without sight or hearing	Equal access to cultural activities is important for inclusion and computer gaming is one of the most common activities in digital culture. However, many people with impairments are excluded from participating. While parallel game universes (PGUs) provide a method to achieve equal access, the question is: how can a balanced collaborative real-time game be designed with the help of PGU for playing without sight or hearing? Balance is a central concept in game design and is important to avoid perceived cheating or disadvantages due to individual or environmental differences. The question was examined with a design science approach, where a game prototype was created in two iterations with a structured design method and evaluated using interviews and observations. In this first step of a more long-term study, ten experienced gamers without impairments were selected with purposive sampling to provide relevant data through simulation of temporary impairments or environmental issues, which can affect many or all gamers. By sorting out these issues first, later testing with actual blind and deaf gamers can focus on more specific issues for each group. The ten participants played either without sight or hearing. The results confirm the use of PGUs for creating a balanced experience but also finds that while multiplayer feel is not optimal, it is a reasonable trade-off for universal access for blind and deaf being able to play together. The results also show that a help system and equal understanding of the game play between the blind and deaf players are important aspects to achieve game balance.

501	GameSE_abstract	Defining ontology combining concepts of massive multi-player online role playing games and organization of large-scale multi-agent systems	Large-scale multi-agent systems (LSMAS) development methods are becoming a necessity in a world of ever growing numbers of computer agents incorporated in various devices and services used by people in all areas of life. Organization in such large-scale systems, becomes therefore a very relevant concept in research on LSMAS, as the mentioned agents are expected to cooperate, compete, and share information, hence improving quality of peoples' life. An example application domain of LSMAS are massive multi-player online games (MMOG), and their specific genre -- MMO role-playing games (MMORPG). MMORPGs provide us with the opportunity to study both large-scale virtual interaction of players (agents), and coordination of large-scale distributed artificial intelligence. In this paper, we will present an ontology of organizational concepts, suited for LSMAS development, merged with an ontology containing elements of a specific MMORPG. Combining these two ontologies with a special accent on identifying elements and aspects of organization, will hopefully present us with a basis for LSMAS structures which follow organizational constraints and are suitable for LSMAS development in the MMORPG context.

502	GameSE_abstract	Staged metaprogramming for shader system development	The shader system for a modern game engine comprises much more than just compilation of source code to executable kernels. Shaders must also be exposed to art tools, interfaced with engine code, and specialized for performance. Engines typically address each of these tasks in an ad hoc fashion, without a unifying abstraction. The alternative of developing a more powerful compiler framework is prohibitive for most engines.In this paper, we identify staged metaprogramming as a unifying abstraction and implementation strategy to develop a powerful shader system with modest effort. By using a multi-stage language to perform metaprogramming at compile time, engine-specific code can consume, analyze, transform, and generate shader code that will execute at runtime. Staged metaprogramming reduces the effort required to implement a shader system that provides earlier error detection, avoids repeat declarations of shader parameters, and explores opportunities to improve performance.To demonstrate the value of this approach, we design and implement a shader system, called Selos, built using staged metaprogramming. In our system, shader and application code are written in the same language and can share types and functions. We implement a design space exploration framework for Selos that investigates static versus dynamic composition of shader features, exploring the impact of shader specialization in a deferred renderer. Staged metaprogramming allows Selos to provide compelling features with a simple implementation.	shading languages;  shaders;  multi-stage languages;  metaprogramming;  computer graphics	Seitz, Kerry A.; Foley, Tim; Porumbescu, Serban D.; Owens, John D.

503	GameSE_abstract	An Agent-based Architecture for AI-Enhanced Automated Testing for XR Systems, a Short Paper	This short paper presents an architectural overview of an agent-based framework called iv4XR for automated testing that is currently under development by an 112020 project with the same name. The framework's intended main use case of is testing the family of Extended Reality (XR) based systems (e.g. 3D games, VR sytems, AR systems), though the approach can indeed be adapted to target other types of interactive systems. The framework is unique in that it is an agent-based system. Agents are inherently reactive, and therefore are arguably a natural match to deal with interactive systems. Moreover, it is also a natural vessel for mounting and combining different AI capabilities, e.g. reasoning, navigation, and learning.

504	GameSE_abstract	Improvement on Navigation Behavior Algorithm of Agent in Visual Simulation	In the visual simulation system, especially large visual game or military simulation training systems, the navigation behavior of agent controls movement of agent through a series of actions response to external environment. The combination of multiple navigation behaviors can create complex behaviors of agent. In the current commonly used behavior determination methods, the combination of different behaviors may cause unreasonable result in some circumstance. Based on navigation behavior, the paper brought out an improved algorithm for navigation behavior of agents, which used heuristic method to balance the local and global behavior priority level, so that the selection of navigation behavior is more reasonable.	visual simulation; agent; navigation behavior; algorithm improvement	Zhang Yong; Li Cun-hua; Yan Bing-yong	MICRO NANO DEVICES, STRUCTURE AND COMPUTING SYSTEMS	https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.159.62		62-+		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen		Not related to Video Games: Studies that were not focused on software engineering applied to industry-scale computer games development.	2	Web of Science	2011	Improvement On Navigation Behavior Algorithm Of Agent In Visual Simulation	https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.159.62	TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
505	GameSE_abstract	Mapping quality requirements for pervasive mobile games	"Games have not received the full attention of the requirements engineering community. This scenario is becoming more critical as we move towards newer forms of games, such as pervasive games. Pervasiveness (the quality that distinguishes pervasive games from traditional digital games) holds several meanings, including being ubiquitous, permeating something, or spreading something, somewhere, in a physical space. Pervasiveness can be recognized in by the boundaries of the game expanding every time it is played, from the virtual (or fictional) world to the real world. Pervasive games are a new form of digital entertainment that has evolved in different forms, such as alternate reality games, transmedia games, and crossmedia games. Sensor technologies, networking capabilities, augmented reality systems, computer vision technology, the internet, and, especially, mobile devices have been responsible for the rapid evolution of this new form of digital product. This paper is focused on ""pervasive mobile games"", which we define as context-aware games that use mobile devices. We bear in mind that mobile devices are currently the main driver for fulfilling the promises of pervasive game playing. Our investigations and experiments on this class of games led us to study the quality requirements for pervasive mobile games. Using different information sources, we gathered a set of interrelated characteristics that are crucial to the success of these games. In this paper, we begin to clarify the definition and scope of pervasive mobile games, which are controversial issues in the literature. Using these fundamentals, we propose a two-level conceptual map of non-functional requirements that helps to realize pervasiveness in pervasive mobile games. These non-functional requirements are then associated with a set of questions that help the designers in verifying tasks and operationalizing the requirements of a game. We also propose a dependence matrix for pervasive game qualities that enhances the insight into pervasiveness and reveals important guidelines for the game designers."

507	GameSE_abstract	Reflecting on development processes in the video game industry	Summary form only given. In the past thirty years consumer video game hardware has progressed from simple 8-bit processors, some dedicated display logic and a few kilobytes of memory to high clock rate multi-core processors coupled with a programmable graphics unit, large memories, high capacity optical and fixed drives, network interfaces, high definition audio/video output, and sophisticated user input devices. With this tremendous increase in capability has come a corresponding increase in the sophistication of video games, broadening their market appeal from a niche into a business that rivals Hollywood. The need to create products of this complexity has driven project team sizes from a couple of hackers in a basement to multi-disciplinary teams often numbering well over a hundred. Allowing project teams of this size to function effectively and deliver products on a manageable schedule has driven the evolution of software and content authoring practices and processes within the games industry. This evolution has drawn on experiences, concepts and tools from the software development industry at large, integrating them into the unique environment of video game development. This talk will provide an overview of some of these processes and best practices, as well as the key challenges in the creation of hit titles such as Skate and Need For Speed.

Most existing game AI is implemented by FSM (Finite State Machine) which has drawbacks in the three respects: requirement of designer's intensive participation; can't adjust strategies or difficulty dynamically; no planning and looking forward.

During the research, the prey and predator genre game of Dead-End is used as test-bed to prove the proposed theory.

510	GameSE_abstract	A design goal and design pattern based approach for development of game engines for mobile platforms	Nowadays, increasing number of game engines are being developed for mobile platforms. As game engines developed for mobile platforms are small scale compared to console and desktop alternatives, game engine development in mobile platforms uses basic software development methods. However, as mobile platforms enhance and development of more complex games become possible, basic development methods will not scale well for advanced game development requirements. This paper examines design of a mobile game engine that provides software maturity by using design goals and design patterns. Our results show that developing a game engine by using a design goal and a design pattern based approach provides a more regular and a clear path for building each aspect of the engine with a high-level perspective of design.

512	GameSE_abstract	Measuring the reverse salience of CPU utilization in video game consoles: The Performance Gap Ratio as a forecasting tool	This study applies and adds to the concepts of recent research revolving around reverse salience as a technology-forecasting methodology. A recent proposal for using performance gap and time gap measurements to determine the magnitude of reverse salience are applied to the disparity between hardware utilization in video game consoles and available hardware (in the form of the x86 central processing unit). Due to the exponential evolution of the principal comparison specification, clock frequency, we propose using a Performance Gap Ratio in addition to the Performance and Time Gap measurements for more detailed characterization of the Technology Gap between the two subjects. Determining the Performance Gap Ratio equation leads to a technology-forecasting device to assist analysts in determining the optimal time to launch a future platform and the specifications that should be included based on presently available hardware.

513	GameSE_abstract	Component-based hierarchical state machine -- A reusable and flexible game AI technology	Finite State Machine (FSM) is the most common used technique to create intelligent character behaviors in video games. But conventional FSM technique has many limitations in game development. The main innovation of this paper is the introduction of software component technology to the implementation of FSMs in game development, which modularizes the states and transitions of FSMs completely. Compared with the conventional FSMs, this technique has three advantages. First, high-level and complex intelligent behaviors can be constructed from a set of low-level and simple behavior rapidly. Second, high-level game designing can be decoupled from low-level game AI programming. Third, game characters equipped with this AI system can exhibit more flexibility and adaptability to the changing game environment.

514	GameSE_abstract	EEP -- A lightweight emotional model: Application to RPG video game characters	A key factor for the playing experience in modern video games is the behavior of the agents in the game. Recently, several mechanisms have been put forward, with the objective to define synthetic emotional models, so as to make the player believe that the responses of the software agents are motivated, in some way, by emotions. However, there is currently no virtual agent model that satisfies the restrictions imposed by the software development of a commercial video game, namely limited design time and computational complexity but offering flexible mechanisms to define emotional reactions. In this paper, we present the Emotional Elicitation Process (EEP), a lightweight emotional model suitable for use in real-time video game environments. EEP includes: (1) a parametric definition for the character emotional profile, (2) a mechanism to translate events into emotions, (3) a method to update mood state by these emotions, and (4) a mechanism to map mood state into different behavior controllers. We illustrate this model by an example from a commercial role-playing game (RPG) scenario, in which a relatively simple set-up of EEP can produce realistic emotional behaviors consuming few computational resources.

515	GameSE_abstract	The Role of Objects in the Coordination of Knowledge-Intensive Projects: A Study of Computer Games Development	This paper addresses the role of objects in enabling the coordination of highly knowledge-intensive projects. An empirical study of project work in the computer games sector explored the role played by milestone schedules. We found that such objects played a central role in coordination in several related ways which could not be explained in terms of previous theorizing. First, such objects exhibited a capacity to act as a meta-object; i.e. representing and inter-relating other objects. Second, through their narrative quality, these objects were critical to collaborating groups' ability to respond to the emergent features of project work. Third, by representing the practices of different groups temporally, these objects made them more accountable to management control.

516	GameSE_abstract	Adaptive Behavior Control Model of Non Player Character	This paper presents the adaptive behavior control model of non player character. The model is based on the theory of control systems and the theory of discrete interval type-2 fuzzy sets and systems. Dynamic changes of the structure of fuzzy rule base with taking into account cognitive parameters of player are executed in the model in on-line mode. It allows to individualize gameplay and to provide interactive interaction of player and NPC. Cognitive parameters of player (gestures, facial expressions, emotions) are determined on basis on the Kinect output data. The quality of dynamic changes of structure of the model (selforganization) is controlled by criteria of videogame enjoyment.	computational intelligence; adaptive system; control system; videogame; non player character; discrete interval type-2 fuzzy set; discrete interval type-2 fuzzy system	Tetyana, Petrenko; Oleg, Tymchuk	UKSIM-AMSS 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER MODELLING AND SIMULATION (UKSIM 2013)	https://doi.org/10.1109/UKSim.2013.68		39-44		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen		AI: Studies that were focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI).	2	Web of Science	2013	Adaptive Behavior Control Model Of Non Player Character	https://doi.org/10.1109/UKSim.2013.68	IEEE	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
517	GameSE_abstract	Comparison of Advanced and Standard Real-Time 3D Rendering Methods for Interactive Landscapes (Short Paper Version)	The use of games-based visualisation technology allows for the development of sophisticated interactive 3D decision support tools. Components of these tools are the various real-time rendering methods that are implemented to facilitate the interactive 3D aspect of the visualisations. Modern graphics hardware allows for the implementation of both simple and complex GPU shader programs. Shaders can be used to compute material and lighting properties that can greatly influence the visual style of a 3D scene. The research presented here shows that more sophisticated 3D shading methods increase user preference when used to render close up scenes. The research also shows that simpler shading methods can still be used to render distant scenes with less visual details present.

518	GameSE_abstract	A Non-intrusive Approach for 2D Platform Game Design Analysis Based on Provenance Data Extracted from Game Streaming	"The usage of provenance data drastically increases the potential for game data mining since it is able to record causes, effects and relationships of events and objects during a game session. However, it commonly requires modifications in the game engine in order to collect such provenance data. The modifications in the game engine may be unviable in commercial (and not open source) systems. In this paper, we propose a novel and non-intrusive approach for collecting provenance data in digital games. Our proposal collects provenance data using image processing mechanisms and pre-defined image patterns, thus avoiding accessing and modifying the source code of the game. Using our approach, we are able to generate, analyze and visualize game design features based on the gameplay flow using provenance data. Furthermore, we evaluated our proposal with a well known commercial 2D game, called ""Super Mario World""."	provenance; game analytics; image processing; image analysis	Jacob, Lidson B.; Kohwalter, Troy C.; Clua, Esteban W.

520	GameSE_abstract	High performance encapsulation in Casanova 2	Encapsulation is a programming technique that helps developers keeping code readable and maintainable. However, encapsulation in modern object oriented languages often causes significant runtime overhead. Developers must choose between clean encapsulated code or fast code. In the application domain of computer games, speed of execution is of utmost importance, which means that the choice between clean and fast usually is decided in favor of the latter. In this paper we discuss how encapsulation is embedded in the Casanova 2 game development language, and show how Casanova 2 allows developers to write encapsulated game code which, thanks to extensive optimization, achieves at the same time high levels of performance.

521	GameSE_abstract	Games based on active NFC objects: Model and security requirements	Cheating in video games is a critical financial matter for game developers. With games now integrating physical objects through NFC, new cheating techniques have emerged, including characteristic boosting of the objects, duplication of objects and introduction of new unauthorized objects. In this paper, we address this problem for games based on active NFC objects. Having active objects in a game allows for new possibilities of interaction yet to be seen, including offline interactions between objects outside of the game. We identify four top security requirements for these games to remain resistant to cheating activities. This analysis is original as it introduces a new model with active NFC objects. Our system is composed of a server, a device (computer, console or smartphone) equipped with an NFC reader, and NFC objects. We perform a risk analysis to identify the weak points of this base system. We list several realistic attacks exploiting the system's weaknesses. Finally, to address them, we design four cost effective security requirements.

522	GameSE_abstract	Investigating the security and digital forensics of video games and gaming systems: A study of PC games and PS4 console	As video games received rapidly increasing attention, modern video games are often concerned with security and privacy issues. Many such video games and game console systems graciously allow player customization, giving people with malicious intent a new vector to lunch security attacks and exchange secretive messages, which posts new challenges to the society of security and digital forensics. In this research, we investigate the security of four popular PC video games and the Sony PlayStation 4 (PS4) game console. Our study showed that each of these video games has at least one feature that may possibly be exploited by attackers for transmitting secretive information, which is very difficult to be detected using current forensic tools. As for gaming consoles, the hard drive of PS4 console is encrypted and consequently most part of its file system cannot be analyzed using current forensic tools such as AccessData's Forensic Toolkit (FTK). However, it is still possible to lunch Denial of Service (DoS) and ARP cache poisoning attacks to the console, which may slow down and halt the system and potentially expose security sensitive information. Based on the above findings, we offer recommendations on how and where security professionals and digital investigators may search for hidden data.

523	GameSE_abstract	Introducing VR First: Unlocking the door to a future in virtual reality [Future Directions]	They say you make your own luck in life, but it certainly doesn't hurt to catch a few breaks along the way. Perhaps that's why when Crytek launched its VR First academic initiative back in January this year, we had a strong sense of our own history. Roughly 17 years earlier, the three brothers who brought the company into existence-Avni, Cevat, and Faruk Yerli-attended the E3 expo in Los Angeles, California, hoping to find an attentive audience for a demo on which Crytek had been working. Instead, they were rejected at almost every turn before eventually (and somewhat forcefully) securing 15 min of tech giant NVIDIA's time to show off their wares as the day's business drew to a close. The rest, as they say, is history. NVIDIA loved the early glimpse into Crytek's CRYENGINE technology that day, setting in motion a chain of events that has seen Crytek continue to establish itself as an influential independent developer of both video games and the software used to create them.

524	GameSE_abstract	Supporting distributed real-time debugging in online games	In these last few years we are witnessing a tremendous change in the way video games are developed. On the one hand, large development teams with a multi-layered organisation are employed. On the other hand, we see an increasing request for online services and functionalities. Combining these two trends together usually results in large projects involving parallel and distributed systems. Despite the adoption of team-oriented source code and asset repository managers, code testing and debugging is still left to human direct management. In particular, distributed debugging is a complex problem due to the synchronisation required between network nodes to correctly reconstruct the sequence of events leading to a malfunctioning feature. To solve the aforementioned problem, we designed and implemented DREAD: an architecture to support distributed debugging in real-time games. When adopting our architecture, developers will record events on edge systems, collect them on a centralised sync, and then consolidate everything in a synchronous way. Following this approach, it will be easily possible to detect unexpected software behaviours and trace back to their causes.

526	GameSE_abstract	Statistical Planning: Building Models of Entropy of Centralized Planning for Multi-Agent Systems	We present a statistical framework to build a family of models of the information entropy of the planning activity which is used to control the behaviors of agents in multi-agent systems such as commercial video-games. We discuss the (practical) hypotheses which are necessary to build this (theoretical) framework and present the probability distributions of the plans among the agents. We confront our entropy models with measures of the planning entropy in five commercial first-person shooters: our theoretical models either frame or else fit the experimental measures.

528	GameSE_abstract	Deep Reinforcement Learning to train agents in a multiplayer First Person Shooter: some preliminary results	Training agents to play in contemporary multiplayer actions game is a challenging task, especially when agents are expected to cooperate in a hostile environment while performing several different actions at the same time. Nonetheless, this topic is assuming a growing importance due to the rampaging diffusion of this game genre and its related e-sports. Agents playing in a multiplayer survival first person shooter game should mimic a human player, hence they should learn how to: survive in unexplored environment, improve their combat skills, deal with unexpected events, coordinate with allies and reach a good ranking among the players community. Our aim has been to design, develop and test a preliminary solution that exploits Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms to train agents without the need of a human expert, with the final goal of creating teams composed only by artificial players.

529	GameSE_abstract	A Metric Learning Approach to Anomaly Detection in Video Games	With the aim of designing automated tools that assist in the video game quality assurance process, we frame the problem of identifying bugs in video games as an anomaly detection (AD) problem. We develop State-State Siamese Networks (S3N) as an efficient deep metric learning approach to AD in this context and explore how it may be used as part of an automated testing tool. Finally, we show by empirical evaluation on a series of Atari games, that S3N is able to learn a meaningful embedding, and consequently is able to identify various common types of video game bugs.

530	GameSE_abstract	Procedural Environment Generation for Cave 3D Model Using OpenSimplex Noise and Marching Cube	In the development of video games, environment is the most important element in video games. Apart from being a playground during the game, the environment also functions as an aesthetic enhancer in video games. The process of making an environment in a video game is usually done by a 3D artist based on a concept art that has been created. The time needed for making an environment 3D model depends on the number of 3D artists involved along with the capabilities of each 3D artists, the scale and the complexity of the 3D model created. These factors affect the amount of resources that must be used to complete the 3D model, such as fee for artist involved and processing time. Procedural environment generation (PEG) is a method for creating various game environments and one way to trim resources in working on 3D models. Much research on PEG for creating cave environment has been done, but most of the research that has been done has a drawback, namely there is no accesses for game developers to compile the structure of the aisle of the cave environment. Through this paper, we hope to produce a PEG that ease video game developers to create 3D models of the cave.

531	GameSE_abstract	Entropy to Control Planning in Video-Games	We consider the problem of controlling the online planning of the behaviors of non-player characters (NPCs) in video-games. We present an urn model of this online planning of the behaviors of NPCs where urns are NPCs, the plans correspond to balls in an urn, and the type of a plan correspond to the color of a ball, to compute the information entropy of the planning activity. We compare this model with the planning entropy measurements from six commercial First-Person Shooters: our model predicts successive variations in entropy and sometimes closely adjusts to experimental values; we thus provide macroscopic parameters and combine them in a simple ratio to control the planning of behaviors of NPCs.

532	GameSE_abstract	We'll Fix It n Post: What Do Bug Fixes in Video Game Update Notes Tell Us?	Bugs that persist into releases ofvideogames can have negative impacts on both developers and users, but particular aspects of testingingamedevelopment can lead to difficultiesineffectively catching these missed bugs. It has become common practice for developers to apply updates to gamesinorder to fix missed bugs. These updates are often accompanied bynotesthat describe the changes to thegameincludedintheupdate. However, some bugs reappear even after anupdateattempts to fix them.Inthis paper, we develop a taxonomy forbugtypesingames that is based on prior work. We examine 12,122bugfixesfrom 723 updates for 30 popular games on the Steam platform. We label thebugfixesincludedinthese updates to identify the frequency of these differentbugtypes, the rate at whichbugtypes recur over multiple updates, and whichbugtypes are treated as more severe. Additionally, we surveygamedevelopers regarding their experience with differentbugtypes andwhataspects ofgamedevelopment they most strongly associate withbugappearance. We find that Information bugs appear the most frequentlyinupdates, while Crash bugs recur the most frequently and are often treated as more severe than otherbugtypes. Finally, we find that challengesintesting, code quality, andbugreproduction have a close association withbugpersistence. These findings should help developers identify which aspects ofgamedevelopment could benefit from greater attentioninorder to prevent bugs. Researchers can use our resultsindevising tools and methods to better identify and address certainbugtypes.

533	GameSE_abstract	Radically Simplifying Game Engines: AI Emotions & Game Self-Evolution	Today, video games are a multi-billion-dollar industry, continuously evolving through the incorporation of new technologies and innovative design. However, current video game software content creation requires extensive and often-times ambiguous planning phases for developing aesthetics, online capabilities, and gameplay mechanics. Design elements can vary significantly relative to the expertise of artists, designers, budget, and overall game engine/software features and capabilities. Game development processes are often extensively long coding sessions, usually involving a highly iterative creative process, where user requirements are rarely provided. Therefore, we propose significantly simplifying game design and development with novel Artificial Cognition Architecture real-time scalability and dynamic emotion core. Rather than utilizing more static emotion state weighting emotion engines (e.g. ExAI), we leverage significant ACA research in successful implementation of analog neural learning bots with Maslowan objective function algorithms. We also leverage AI- based Artificial Psychology software which utilizes ACA's fine grained self-evolving emotion modeling in humanistic avatar patients for Psychologist training. An ACA common cognitive core provides the gaming industry with wider applications across video game genres. A modular, scalable, and cognitive emotion game architecture implements Non-Playable Character (NPC) learning and self-evolution. ACA models NPC's with fine grained emotions, providing interactive dynamic personality traits for a more realistic game environment and enables NPC self-evolution under the influence of both other NPC's and players. Furthermore, we explore current video game design engine architecture (e.g. Unity, Unreal Engine) and propose an ACA integration approach. We apply artificial cognition and emotion intelligence modeling to engender video games with more distinct, realistic consumer gaming experiences, while simultaneously ...

535	GameSE_abstract	A high performance visual profiler for games	Video games are software products with the purpose to entertain its players. Unfortunately, the performance of video games can suddenly decrease; this phenomenon is called a frame drop, and causes the amount of fun experienced by players to drop. To avoid this behavior, usually the process of creating a video game involves trying to improving the performance of a game, usually aided by use of a performance profiler. We present a performance profiler designed to find causes of frame drops and other bottlenecks in video games. Current performance profilers are not suitable for video games because they are often slow while collecting data, so the interactive element of video games is lost and recreating events that cause frame drops is next to impossible. Furthermore, they accumulate information over relatively large periods of time making temporary drops in performance invisible and their causes difficult to find.This article describes a tool called GamePro. GamePro is a performance profiler that consists of two components: a data logger and a data presenter. The data logger is fast during run-time, has a powerful snapshot feature that collects timed data, and can inspect native and scripting methods. The data presenter is able to show causes of sudden drops in performance and other bottlenecks in software. Visualization is used to present the data and to enable the developers to find performance issues efficiently and effectively.	visualization;  video games;  profiling;  performance;  frame drops;  development tools	Roza, Michiel; Schroders, Mark; van de Wetering, Huub	Sandbox '09: Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Video Games	https://doi.org/10.1145/1581073.1581090		103-110	"@inproceedings{10.1145/1581073.1581090,

A central problem facing practitioners is however the increasing complexity of user-game interaction in modern games, which places challenges on the evaluation of interaction using traditional user-oriented approaches. Gameplay metrics are instrumentation data which detail user behavior within the virtual environment of digital games, forming accurate and detailed datasets about user behavior that supplement existing user-testing methods such as playtesting and usability testing. In this paper existing work on gameplay metrics is reviewed, and spatial analysis of gameplay metrics introduced as a new approach in the toolbox of user-experience testing and research.

537	GameSE_abstract	Visual generative behavior patterns to facilitate game development	The worldwide videogame and interactive entertainment industry revenue is expected to reach over $50 billion in 2009 [2]. The majority of the effort in game development revolves around content creation and many resources are spent on it. Game companies construct or buy a set of content creation tools to aid the designers in their work. However, these tools only focus on the artwork, interfaces, game levels, and so on but none of them really focus on the content which is related to the gameplay or the game story, that is, the dynamic aspect of the game. Creating this story-related content, namely the scripts for the behavioral aspect in computer games, and translating this into appropriate program code is a very difficult task. For complex scripting, the developer has to resort to manually write code using scripting languages (i.e. Lua or Python). Furthermore, these languages are not tailored for games which also do not make them easier. Over the years, game developers have come up with many predefined (parts of) solutions to improve the development process [1][3]. In addition, in practice, people are also trying to avoid writing long scripts by using existing scripts and customizing them to fit their needs.

544	GameSE_abstract	ContextLua: dynamic behavioral variations in computer games	Behavioral variations are central to modern computer games as they are making the gameplay a more interesting user experience. However, these variations significantly add to the implementation complexity. We discuss the domain of computer games with respect to dynamic behavioral variations and argue that context-oriented programming is of special interest for this domain. This motivates our extension to the dynamic scripting language Lua, which is frequently used in the development of computer games. Our newly provided programming constructs allow game developers to use layers for defining and activating variations of the basic gameplay.

545	GameSE_abstract	EyeGuitar: making rhythm based music video games accessible using only eye movements	Rhythm based music games such as Guitar Hero are hugely popular and allow gamers to take on the role of a famous musician. To play such games you must press keys on virtual guitars in various combinations in time with the music. Gamers with severe physical disabilities cannot always use traditional input devices so alternative methods of input are required to play such games. Eye-gaze is a high bandwidth modality that can support this if suitable interaction techniques exist. By analysing actual gameplay a suitable eye-gaze interaction technique is designed for a Guitar Hero style game. We present results from a user study demonstrating that users are able to score higher with the gaze technique than using a keyboard for game input, albeit at the cost of gameplay. The experiment concludes with a case study in which a young person with physical disabilities is able to successfully play the game using only eye movements.	gaze gaming;  gaze control;  eye tracking;  eye gaze;  disability	Vickers, Stephen; Istance, Howell; Smalley, Matthew	ACE '10: Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology	https://doi.org/10.1145/1971630.1971641		36-39	"@inproceedings{10.1145/1971630.1971641,

546	GameSE_abstract	Game development documentation and institutional collection development policy	Videogames and other new media artifacts constitute an important part of our cultural and economic landscape and collecting institutions have a responsibility to collect and preserve these materials for future access. Unfortunately, these kinds of materials present unique challenges for collecting institutions including problems of collection development, technological preservation, and access. This paper presents findings from a grant-funded project focused on examining documentation of the creative process in game development. Data includes twelve qualitative interviews conducted with individuals involved in the game development process, spanning a number of different roles and institution types. The most pressing findings are related to the nature of documentation in the videogame industry: project interviews indicate that the game development process does produce significant and important documentation as traditionally conceived by collecting institutions, ranging from game design documents to email correspondence and business reports. However, while it does exist, traditional documentation does not adequately, or even, at times, truthfully represent the project or the game creation process as a whole. In order to adequately represent the development process, collecting institutions also need to seek out and procure numerous versions of games and game assets as well as those game assets that are natural byproducts of the design process like gamma and beta versions of the game, for example, vertical slices, or different renderings of graphical elements.	videogames;  software development;  non-functional requirements;  iterative programming;  history of computing;  game development;  documentation;  cultural institutions;  archives	Winget, Megan A.; Sampson, Wiliam Walker	JCDL '11: Proceedings of the 11th annual international ACM/IEEE joint conference on Digital libraries	https://doi.org/10.1145/1998076.1998083		29-38	"@inproceedings{10.1145/1998076.1998083,

547	GameSE_abstract	Enduring interaction: an approach to analysis and design of animated gestural interfaces in creative computing systems	This paper provides an interdisciplinary reflection on the nature meaning-making involving users and animated gestural interfaces. In particular, we propose a new model for analysis of creative computing systems incorporating gestural input into dynamically animated interfaces. Our contributions are based on a theoretical framework synthesizing embodied cognition approaches in cognitive science, phenomenology in philosophy, and user interface design in computing. We introduce the term enduring interaction to refer to the phenomenon of bodily and conceptually engaging interaction within constantly changing computational environments. Our construct centralizes the issue of how users' motor-sensory experiences inform their construction of meaning in the design of interactive systems. We argue that creative computing systems, a class of artifacts including types of hobbyist websites, video games, and computer-based artworks, require a new design perspective quite distinct from user-centric interface design approaches focused on productivity-oriented applications. Using examples including outcomes of the Gestural Narrative and Interactive Expression (GeNIE) project (Harrell, PI; Chow and Erik Loyer collaborators) along with existing prevalent, exceptional, or historically significant artifacts, we articulate a continuum of various kinds of engagement, showing design implications of our perspective, enabling users to use gestural interaction (through multi-touch and gyroscope/accelerometer-based input devices) to result in narratively salient, evocative, and even intimate interaction mechanisms in interactive narrative environments.	phenomenology;  interface design;  gestural interfaces;  embodied cognition;  digital media	Chow, Kenny K.N.; Harrell, D.

548	GameSE_abstract	Feasibility study of utility-directed behaviour for computer game agents	Utility-based control (UBC) hasn't been widely adopted for commercial game AI. Some of the reasons for this are that UBC is perceived to be: (1) resource intensive, (2) difficult to design complex behaviours with, and (3) difficult to scale for use in complex environments. This paper investigates these perceptions to see if UBC is suitable for controlling the behaviour of non-player characters in commercial games. The investigation compares agents using a UBC system against two control systems that are more frequently used in commercial games: finite state machines (FSMs), considered a simple control system, and goal-oriented action planning (GOAP), considered a complex control system. We present a feasibility study which suggests that: (1) UBC is more resource intensive than FSMs but less so than GOAP; (2) it is reasonably simple to create complex behaviours using UBC; (3) UBC doesn't scale as well as FSMs or GOAP for use in complex environments.	finite state machine;  goal-oriented action planning;  utility	Sloan, Colm; Kelleher, John D.; Mac Namee, Brian	ACE '11: Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology	https://doi.org/10.1145/2071423.2071430		1-6	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2071423.2071430,

549	GameSE_abstract	Modeling player-like behavior for game AI design	The design of artificial intelligence in computer games is an important component of a player's game play experience. As games are becoming more life-like and interactive, the need for more realistic game AI will increase. This is particularly the case with respect to AI that simulates how human players act, behave and make decisions. The purpose of this research is to establish a model of player-like behavior that may be effectively used to inform the design of artificial intelligence to more accurately mimic a player's decision making process. The research uses a qualitative analysis of player opinions and reactions while playing a first person shooter video game, with recordings of their in-game actions, speech and facial characteristics.

550	GameSE_abstract	Adapting content presentation and control to player personality in videogames	In this paper, we present a first step towards a personality based framework for adapting videogame content to the player, in which the game infers a player's type from his behaviour, then selects how content is managed and presented to the player based on the inferred player type. This paper focuses on the later aspect.We detail how we assessed (offline) the player's Myers-Briggs personality type through a questionnaire, inferred his player type based on the Demographic Game Design model (conqueror, manager, wanderer, and participant), and propose how player type can enhance the player's experience by informing the game on three distinct aspects: difficulty management, presentation and depth of control over certain aspects of the game.To evaluate our approach, we developed a videogame, Grim Business, asked players of different types to play under different conditions and evaluated the experience using a questionnaire based on the GameFlow model. Our results suggest that player immersion, and consequently enjoyment, is higher when the game adapts to the player type.	player modeling;  player experience;  personality;  game adaptation	Dias, Rodrigo; Martinho, Carlos	ACE '11: Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology	https://doi.org/10.1145/2071423.2071446		1-8	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2071423.2071446,

In this paper, we present a study in which 36 novice inspectors were divided into two identical groups, and they evaluated a mobile game using one of the two playability heuristic sets. In the second task, the inspectors analyzed playability problems that were collected from the game, and assigned heuristics to describe the problems. The results show that a playability heuristic set needs to cover the main aspects of playability in order to be effectively used during the evaluation.

553	GameSE_abstract	Exploring the usefulness of finger-based 3D gesture menu selection	Counting using one's fingers is a potentially intuitive way to enumerate a list of items and lends itself naturally to gesture-based menu systems. In this paper, we present the results of the first comprehensive study on Finger-Count menus to investigate its usefulness as a viable option for 3D menu selection tasks. Our study compares 3D gesture-based finger counting (Finger Count menus) with two gesture-based menu selection techniques (Hand-n-Hold, Thumbs-Up), derived from existing motion-controlled video game menu selection strategies, as well as 3D Marking menus. We examined selection time, selection accuracy and user preference for all techniques. We also examined the impact of different spatial layouts for menu items and different menu depths. Our results indicate that Finger-Count menus are significantly faster than the other menu techniques we tested and are the most liked by participants. Additionally, we found that while Finger-Count menus and 3D Marking menus have similar selection accuracy, Finger-Count menus are almost twice as fast compared to 3D Marking menus.	3d interaction;  3d marking menu;  depth camera;  finger-count menu;  gesture recognition;  hand-n-hold menu;  menu selection;  selection;  thumbs-up menu;  user study;  video games	Kulshreshth, Arun; LaViola, Joseph J.

554	GameSE_abstract	A BDI Game Master Agent for Computer Role-Playing Games	In this paper we describe an approach for developing an intelligent game master (GM) for computer role-playing games. The role of the GM is to set up the game environment, manage the narrative ow and enforce the game rules whilst keeping the players engaged. Our approach is to use the popular Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model of agents to developing a GM. We describe the process for creating such a GM and how we implemented a prototype of it for a scenario in the Neverwinter Nights (NWN) game. We describe the evaluation of our prototype with human participants who played the chosen NWN scenario both with and without the BDI GM. The comparison survey completed by the participants shows that the system with the BDI GM was the clear winner with respect to game replayability, flexibility, objective setting and overall interest; thus, validating our hypothesis that a BDI GM will provide game players with a better gaming experience.

555	GameSE_abstract	RUIS: a toolkit for developing virtual reality applications with spatial interaction	We introduce Reality-based User Interface System (RUIS), a virtual reality (VR) toolkit aimed for students and hobbyists, which we have used in an annually organized VR course for the past four years. RUIS toolkit provides 3D user interface building blocks for creating immersive VR applications with spatial interaction and stereo 3D graphics, while supporting affordable VR peripherals like Kinect, PlayStation Move, Razer Hydra, and Oculus Rift. We describe a novel spatial interaction scheme that combines freeform, full-body interaction with traditional video game locomotion, which can be easily implemented with RUIS. We also discuss the specific challenges associated with developing VR applications, and how they relate to the design principles behind RUIS. Finally, we validate our toolkit by comparing development difficulties experienced by users of different software toolkits, and by presenting several VR applications created with RUIS, demonstrating a variety of spatial user interfaces that it can produce.	3D user interface;  software toolkit;  unity	Takala, Tuukka M.

Although the ways in which we can interact with games have improved over recent years, the digital world we are interacting with is still normally confined to the screen and restricted by predefined scenarios.In this paper, we introduce the i.Ge engine, a real-time video game level editor that allows users to interact with their own environment to create game content with real everyday objects, making them part of the level design.

557	GameSE_abstract	Exploring 3D User Interface Technologies for Improving the Gaming Experience	We present the results of a comprehensive video game study which explores how the gaming experience is effected when several 3D user interface technologies are used simultaneously. We custom designed an air-combat game integrating several 3DUI technologies (stereoscopic 3D, head tracking, and finger-count gestures) and studied the combined effect of these technologies on the gaming experience. Our game design was based on existing design principles for optimizing the usage of these technologies in isolation. Additionally, to enhance depth perception and minimize visual discomfort, the game dynamically optimizes stereoscopic 3D parameters (convergence and separation) based on the user's look direction. We conducted a within subjects experiment where we examined performance data and self-reported data on users perception of the game. Our results indicate that participants performed significantly better when all the 3DUI technologies (stereoscopic 3D, head-tracking and finger-count gestures) were available simultaneously with head tracking as a dominant factor. We explore the individual contribution of each of these technologies to the overall gaming experience and discuss the reasons behind our findings.	air-combat game;  finger-count;  game design;  game-play metrics;  head tracking;  player behavior;  stereoscopic 3d;  user experience.;  user study;  video games	Kulshreshth, Arun; LaViola, Joseph J.

Real-time recognition of affective states, however, requires the application of costly feature extraction methods and/or labor-intensive annotation of large datasets, especially in the case of Asian languages where large annotated datasets are seldom available. To improve recognition accuracy, we propose the use of cognitive context in the form of ""emotion-sensitive"" intentions. Intentions are often represented through dialogue acts and, as an emotion-sensitive model of dialogue acts, a tagset of interpersonal-relations-directing interpersonal acts (the IA model) is proposed. The model's adequacy is assessed using a sentiment classification task in comparison with two well-known dialogue act models, the SWBD-DAMSL and the DIT++. For the assessment, five Japanese in-game dialogues were annotated with labels of sentiments and the tags of all three dialogue act models which were used to enhance a baseline sentiment classifier system.

566	GameSE_abstract	WhatShapeWhatColor: Designing a Puzzle Game to Elicit the Field Dependence-Independence Cognitive Style	Theories in cognitive psychology suggest that people differ in the way we process information as we tend to develop different cognitive styles. Recent research in Human-Computer Interaction has revealed that people who have different cognitive styles tend to develop different strategies, achieve different performance, and have different experience when interacting with information systems. Therefore, there is a need for customizing such systems to fit their users' cognitive styles. However, the elicitation of users' cognitive styles is a time-consuming and a non-practical process that requires human intervention. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we present the design of WhatShapeWhatColor, which is a web-based memory puzzle game that aims to elicit Field Dependence-Independence, a well established cognitive style, implicitly and with no human intervention. Moreover, we report the results of an evaluation user-study with 108 participants, which revealed that the implicit and automatic elicitation is feasible in various game difficulty levels. Such results could increase the practicability and applicability of elicitation techniques to enable designers deliver experiences that could be adapted to their users' cognitive preferences and needs.

567	GameSE_abstract	Research on flattening style design of game interface based on cognitive psychology	Interactive interface, also called user interface, is a channel for users to exchange information and data with computers. Interface enables users to operate the hardware system conveniently and efficiently, and enables the hardware system to effectively transmit the current working state, operation results and other information data to users, which is an important part of software products. The wide application of flat style in mobile game interface design enables players to pay more attention to the playing method, mechanism and artistic aesthetics in the game world, and obtain a smoother and more efficient game experience. The flat interface design can provide users with a more convenient way to use, and the main purpose is to continuously improve the user's experience, and then make users more satisfied with it. This paper studies and analyzes the flat interface design of mobile games in the Internet age, hoping to promote the popularization and application of the flat interface design and bring better experience to users.

In order to study this effect specifically, we took Defend of the Ancient 2, one of the most popular games on steam, as the background to analyze the change of players' behavior before and after game updates. By collecting 17,253 players' data and developing a two-way fixed effects model, two founding were discovered in our study. First, game updates can significantly enhance players' engagement. Second, the effect of game updates is moderated by players' game duration and recorded game rounds.

569	GameSE_abstract	Grounded Theory of Accessible Game Development	Digital games represent a prominent element of popular culture, with the ability to play as well as participate in video game discourse being a matter of inclusion and equality. However, many digital games are inaccessible for players with disabilities. Only a small amount of literature has sought to understand the difficulties developers experience when making an accessible game. This literature indicates that developers experience numerous difficulties making accessible games, yet underlying causes of these difficulties are not well understood. The present research uses interviews and a grounded theory approach to illuminate the experiences that developers encounter when trying to make accessible games. We identify several difficulties that the game developers experience and describe how these difficulties are affected by knowledge and motivations of the individual developer, organisational attributes of the work environment, and the use of external resources such as drawing upon the experiences of players with disabilities.

570	GameSE_abstract	Study on Multi-Directional Gravity Liquid Simulation Applied to 3D Computer Generated Images	Liquid simulation is an important computer imaging technology. It is complex, difficult, and time-consuming for computer graphics creators. In the visual experience of daily life, the physical state of liquid is only affected by a single external force, gravity. However, in a certain incident, it is necessary to present the physical dynamics of the liquid subjected to multiple forces greater than gravity including fountains and waves in a surrealistic movie, animation, video game, and other multimedia scene design. Generally, in 3D computer-generated images technology, different software has a similar mechanism to produce liquid simulation. Then, with different parameters, such as container, gravity, drag, wind, waves, and vortex, the liquid form consists of many particles is generated. After the visual appeal is confirmed, the liquid form is further transformed into thousands of mesh structures or abundant polygons that can be rendered. However, there are many detailed operations in the process that affects the simulation results. This research attempts to guide the flow of water molecules from different directions at the same time or intermittently with 2 to 6 gravitational forces to shape the desired appearance, flowing in a specific direction or other free paths. By testing and operating methods and using a variety of software with different functions, such as Autodesk Maya, NexLimit Real Flow, and Adobe After Effect, this study sorts out the technical process of 3D computer-generated images for multi-directional gravity liquid simulation and the essential parameter setting adjustment. Finally, it takes the production and development of the animated film 'the Path of Water' as an actual operation example to illustrate the simulation results of the explosion or transformation of the liquid effect under multidirectional gravity. The result provides a reference for practical computer graphics.	communication; computer graphics; liquid simulation; multi-directional gravity	Lin, C.-H.; Tseng, P.-Y.	4th IEEE International Conference on Knowledge Innovation and Invention 2021, ICKII 2021	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICKII51822.2021.9574735		160-165		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen		Not related to Video Games: Studies that were not focused on software engineering applied to industry-scale computer games development.	2	Scopus	2021	Study on Multi-Directional Gravity Liquid Simulation Applied to 3D Computer Generated Images	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118986297&doi=10.1109%2fICKII51822.2021.9574735&partnerID=40&md5=e091f2fd388bdf3cfd4b919feb5d9957	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc	nan; Venue; References; Year; Bibtex
571	GameSE_abstract	A Tale of Creativity and Struggles: Team Practices for Bottom-Up Innovation in Virtual Game Jams	Game jams are intense and time-sensitive online or face-to-face game creation events where a digital game is developed in a relatively short time frame (typically 48 to 72 hours) exploring given design constraints and end results are shared publicly. They have increasingly become emerging sites where non-professional game developers, amateurs, and hobbyists engage in bottom-up technological innovation by collaboratively designing and developing more creative and novel digital products. Drawing on 28 interviews, in this paper we focus on how game developers collaborate as small teams to innovate game design and development from the bottom up in virtual game jams (i.e., exclusively online) and the unique role of virtual game jams in their technological innovation. We contribute to CSCW by providing new empirical evidence of how team practices for innovation may emerge in a novel technology community that is not widely studied before. We also expand a growing research agenda in CSCW on explicating nuanced social behaviors, processes, and consequences of bottom-up technological innovation.	computer-mediated collaboration; game development; indie game development; team practices; technological innovation; virtual game jams	Freeman, G.; McNeese, N.J.

574	GameSE_abstract	Positioning game review as a crucial element of game user feedback in the ongoing development of independent video games	The research is designed to determine the extent to which game reviews on the Steam platform can be used as a means of discerning the common needs of players and any flaws in existing games. In this study, the independent game No Man's Sky is adopted as the subject of the research. Results indicated that the majority of reviews reflect shortcomings of No Man's Sky and that the developer has acknowledged these shortcomings. Statistical research and the analytic hierarchy process supported that variables on the Steam platform reflect players' common needs and constitute a model by means of which developers can assess constructive data.

575	GameSE_abstract	The Analysis of Time Series Forecasting on Resource Provision of Cloud-based Game Servers	The server workloads of large-scale online video games are elastic and on-demand. The workload can range from tens to thousands of server instances in short periods. In fact, a cloud-based video game ecosystem can reach a workload of millions of players every week. Given such a large scale, even a small portion of over-provisioning leads to a significant amount of resource idling and a high cost of waste. It is essential to define an effective forecasting model on the game session workloads given a time span. The effectiveness shall be measured by metrics representing Service Level Objectives (SLOs). In this work, we analyze time series forecasting models using ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM to predict the number of virtual machines in need of cloud resource monitoring data. In addition, we define service-level metrics for measuring effectiveness based on factors of over/under provision and ratio of resource waste. We analyze models with 16 fleets with an average of 2754 game servers over a four-month-long period of time in the production environment. We observe that our LSTM model is the most accurate in forecasting the demand of virtual machines in terms of RMSE and MAE. Further analysis using metrics of SLOs, we observe that the LSTM model leads to more cases of under-provisioning than ARIMA and Prophet do. The LSTM model forecasts the demand of virtual machines with less over-provision ratio than ARIMA and Prophet do for 14 out of 16 fleets. Using the LSTM model, we further evaluate the forecasting effect across different time spans of a single fleet and across multiple fleets within the same time span.

577	GameSE_abstract	Sensor-Based Emotion Tracking System for Computer Games	The game development industry is among the leading industries globally, and in 2020, gaming emerged as a popular entertainment activity upon the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, competition among gaming companies is high. Hence, they try to adopt new technologies often. Gaming brings multiple feelings for the gamer. At times, the conditions may get even worse from the game's end where the gamer may end up venting out his rage and annoyance. Hence, there is a massive possibility for the gamer to switch to another game which may result in the company to lose its customers. In that scenario, this system can monitor the emotional states of the gamer while playing and manipulate the gaming environment, sound environment, enemy behavior, and gamer mechanism according to the emotional state of the gamer. The sensor-based emotion tracking system identifies the gamer's emotional state using facial emotions, detected through a webcam and heart rate, detected through sensors. The development was carried out through the machine learning models, open cv, Arduino techniques, and reactive programming. The emotional state and facial emotions that will be tracked will count to an accuracy of above 95%. Through that, the target will be to make the gamer satisfied by building appreciation for the services given and by improving the gamer's gaming experience and retain the gamer with the game provider.	detect; emotional state; game; gamer; sensor	Wickramasinghe, W.R.M.G.K.; Devduni, R.M.B.; Dasanayaka, D.T.C.B.; Mohomed, M.N.N.; Kumari, S.; Dassanayake, T.

578	GameSE_abstract	Developing a Video Game Accessibility Toolkit for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired	Accessibility is an aspect of video game development that has not been worked on to a great extent yet. It can have a great impact on gameplay, for those with some type of disability, and another large number of players who use those features to enhance their gaming experience. This potential is something that industry is beginning to consider seriously, as attested by the Accessibility in Video Games award at The Game Awards ceremony. Some of these features, such as subtitles, have been implemented in video games for a long time, but in a simplistic way and without the support of other tools that allow accessibility issues to be addressed from several fronts. The goal of this project is the development of an Accessible Audio Toolkit that extend the Unity environment allowing creators to easily introduce configurable hearing accessibility techniques into their games, showing sound direction using a compass or a 3D radar, and displaying more configurable subtitles. The results have been experimentally verified, adding these features to a simple game where sound is very important, putting players to play it without sound, in order to confirm the effectiveness of our tool. The software has been published on the Unity Asset Store, allowing the developers community to integrate it into their own projects.

579	GameSE_abstract	The Role Playing Games from Classic to Modern: Future Perspective	This paper deals with Role Playing Games which known as a RPG in abbreviation, and it also review old and current RPG genre video games that found in the market from a well-known classic to its modern contemporary. RPG is a game genre that can be defined as a game in which its system focuses on Role-play aspect found in-game such as role-play as a hero or any specified class in-game, this also include player-built character experience or Meta build. The role-playing game can be seen as story-focused, there is always been a stake that the player has to conquer and it could be something about saving a world by defeating a boss, the player will be put in a shoe of the main character and it is up to the player to build the character to its fullest potential. On the other hand, RPG is also well known for its intricate storyline especially that of Japanese role-playing game also known as JRPG and over the year the story of the RPG genre has evolved becoming more serious and tackling what could be assumed as a realistic and fantasy depiction of a real-life world.

580	GameSE_abstract	Games by End-Users: Analyzing Development Environments	Digital games are increasingly present in people's lives, especially in younger people's lives. At times, users want to do more than just play games produced by specialized companies, but would also like to customize them or create and play their own games and share them with their friends. Enabling users with no programming knowledge to develop their games raises several challenges, that range from game design to technical aspects. In this paper, our goal was to investigate the following research question 'What strategies and constructs do game engines use to allow users with no previous knowledge of programming to create games?'. To do so, we used the Semiotic Inspection Method to analyze two game engines aimed mainly at this audience - GDevelop and Stencyl. As a result, we have identified the main strategies and constructs used in the tools to support game programming by end-users.	end-user programming; games; scientific SIM	De Souza, J.G.R.; Prates, R.O.

581	GameSE_abstract	Changing the Game: Adapting Capture the Flag to Underrepresented Groups	Capture the Flag (CTF) contests have become popular in the cybersecurity community to display and cultivate skills related to cybersecurity. Professionals within the cybersecurity community participate in them to claim 'bragging' rights, conferences use them as a hands-on workshop activity, and universities sponsor them to build interest in cybersecurity. Skill in navigating a CTF contest is a source of prestige, and infers cybersecurity skills. The traditional cybersecurity CTF game uses a competitive context rather than cooperative. Competitors is may work alone or form teams. Games and other technology design are noted for reflecting the creators. Since the majority of cybersecurity professionals and academics are non-diverse, the games they create reflect their cultural bias. One of the ways to reach underrepresented groups, such as women and minorities, is provide learning options that reduce cultural bias. If the major learning option in cybersecurity is CTF games that reflect a traditional cultural bias, underrepresented groups are at a disadvantage. With this in mind, this research developed a game framework designed for the participants to build an original Capture the Flag. The game framework removes the need for designers to build game functionality, while still retaining full control over the content. Consequently, the Capture the Flag challenges can reflect the interests and cultural background of any group of designers. In addition to the game play and the opportunity to tailor content, the framework also tracks how effective the challenges from the various design teams are based on the interaction of the participants with those challenges.	broadening participation in computing; cultural bias; cybersecurity; gamification	Horcher, A.-M.	2021 Research on Equity and Sustained Participation in Engineering, Computing, and Technology, RESPECT 2021 - Conference Proceedings	https://doi.org/10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620717				Excluded	Excluded	new_screen		Not related to Video Games: Studies that were not focused on software engineering applied to industry-scale computer games development.	2	Scopus	2021	Changing the Game: Adapting Capture the Flag to Underrepresented Groups	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123611314&doi=10.1109%2fRESPECT51740.2021.9620717&partnerID=40&md5=08c87e86e1c57fd6fd6be91249a651c8	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc	nan; Venue; References; Pages; Year; Bibtex

This project, which is a continuation of the research presented previously in [1], creates an optimized pathway back to the beginning of a user's recorded route using a modified (modded) Minecraft environment. We construct an octree in order to create a graph of connected nodes, then integrate our mod with a simulated 'As Real As It Gets' (ARAIG) wearable haptic suit. This provides a visual representation of the physical feedback the user would receive if they were to wear it. Finally, we ask a small group of users to test this program and to give us feedback based upon their experiences, before discussing our next steps in the project. These next steps include broadening the scope of our Minecraft mod and integrating these algorithms into physical mediums.

584	GameSE_abstract	Developing a Game Engine in C# Programming Language	A video game refers to a digital breed of entertainment experienced on various devices, including personal computers, gaming consoles, tablets, and smartphones. For some time now, video games have not been perceived as a form of play solely reserved for children but as the way of spending the leisure time enjoyed by a vast of adults worldwide. As a result, the video games sector has become a behemoth larger than the movie and music industry combined, and it is growing on daily basis. The process of developing video games is more complex than ever which is the reason why every now and then novel game engine is proposed. The objective of this paper is to present features of a game engine that was implemented in C# programming language. The introduced game engine draws on MonoGame library that contains collection of functions and commands thus facilitating the creation of a virtual space and supporting the development of video games. The functionalities and capabilities of the presented game engine are demonstrated on the examples of 2D and 3D video games prototypes.	.NET; C#; game development; MonoGame; XNA	Srsen, M.; Orehovacki, T.	2021 44th International Convention on Information, Communication and Electronic Technology, MIPRO 2021 - Proceedings	https://doi.org/10.23919/MIPRO52101.2021.9596801		1717-1722		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen		Not related to Video Games: Studies that were not focused on software engineering applied to industry-scale computer games development.	2	Scopus	2021	Developing a Game Engine in C# Programming Language	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123049940&doi=10.23919%2fMIPRO52101.2021.9596801&partnerID=40&md5=5a486739f17b933b1200bb8969e9443f	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc	nan; Venue; References; Year; Bibtex

Game design and user testing for the elderly is, therefore, an important consideration. In this paper, we present experiences from usability tests of a touchscreen puzzle game with elderly users. As a result of the user tests, we observed some common behaviors. In general, the elderly testers found it difficult to approach the game without instructions and were not able to get the game going using only trial and error. To get started with the game, the testers preferred animated tutorials over detailed written instructions. Additionally, the testers praised pop-up warning messages that appeared when they made mistakes. We also noted that within our test group individuals had somewhat different mental models about the game and its mechanics, which made improving the game design difficult.	elderly; user testing; video games	Saari, J.; Hynninen, T.	2021 44th International Convention on Information, Communication and Electronic Technology, MIPRO 2021 - Proceedings	https://doi.org/10.23919/MIPRO52101.2021.9596921		1613-1617		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen		Serious games or gamification: Studies that were focused on the social and educational impact of video games, such as serious games.	2	Scopus	2021	Game Development for the Elderly: Experiences from Usability Tests in the Wild	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123049415&doi=10.23919%2fMIPRO52101.2021.9596921&partnerID=40&md5=77e30dff6f479db058c76aae729bd896	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc	nan; Venue; References; Year; Bibtex
586	GameSE_abstract	Task Decomposition of Network Services for Deploying in Heterogeneous Network Computing Nodes	With the development of computing and network technology, some emerging network services, such as augmenting reality games, smart surveillance, get increasingly complex and call for extensive computing resources. Componentized software architectures are designed to expedite the software development, while they also grant new dimensions to deploy the functional components of a network service in different computing nodes to improve the utilization of computing resources distributed in the network. When a service has a complex structure, how to get its components into different groups, i.e. task decomposition, considering both the computing resource conditions close to end-user and the execution time requirement, is a prerequisite for efficient task allocation and processing. This paper proposes a task decomposition model for componentized network services. The model considers the communication interaction between task elements and full utilization of computing resources in heterogeneous nodes, like cloud, edge, and the mobile terminal, as well as execution time requirement, to decompose a service into subtasks that retain its original componentized structure. Its solutions can simplify service deployment. The paper also proposes an improved genetic algorithm for the solution. The simulation results show that the proposed approach can get suitable decomposition results of diverse granularity in a short time and can reduce the expected task execution time and realize the use of network resources effectively.	componentized network services; computing resources condition aware; integer programming; task decomposition	Wei, L.; Zhou, F.; Feng, L.; Yu, P.; Li, W.; Zhao, M.; Yan, X.; Wu, J.

587	GameSE_abstract	Data-Driven Agile Requirements Elicitation through the Lenses of Situational Method Engineering	Ubiquitous digitalization has led to the continuous generation of large amounts of digital data, both in organizations and in society at large. In the requirements engineering community, there has been a growing interest in considering digital data as new sources for requirements elicitation, in addition to stake-holders. The volume, dynamics, and variety of data makes iterative requirements elicitation increasingly continuous, but also unstructured and complex, which current agile methods are unable to consider and manage in a systematic and efficient manner. There is also the need to support software evolution by enabling a synergy of stakeholder-driven requirements elicitation and management with data-driven approaches. In this study, we propose extension of agile requirements elicitation by applying situational method engineering. The research is grounded on two studies in the business domains of video games and online banking.

588	GameSE_abstract	Dynamic Game-Based Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation in LEO-Multiaccess Edge Computing	The offloading of computing tasks in edge computing has always been a research hotspot and difficulty in recent years. As an effective way to run various applications on mobile devices with limited resources, it has been extensively studied by scholars from all walks of life. However, the traditional ground-based network-based edge computing network architecture cannot meet the needs of edge users with limited geographic areas. Therefore, this paper proposes an LEO (low earth orbit) satellite-based multiaccess edge computing network architecture and establishes a differential game model for this architecture. To obtain the Nash equilibrium solution of the open loop and the Nash equilibrium solution of the feedback for the task offloading amount, the relationship between the user's income and the QoE level under the optimal task offloading amount is finally analyzed and discussed.

589	GameSE_abstract	Development of 'School Nocturnble': A Sensitive Game with Eye Trackers	"This paper presents ""School Nocturnble,"" a new type of eye-tracking game, and explains about the development process. Recently, the game industry has been actively applying various new technologies into games. It's because gamers, who want more realistic and new experience through game, have been reacting positively towards the industry's new attempts. One of the field that the industry tries to innovate through new technology is a gaming controller. Eye-tracking technology is one of many technological innovations in development of gaming controllers. ""School Nocturnble"" is a 2D side-scrolling puzzle adventure game that uses eye-tracker as an assisting gaming controller. A single player can control the protagonist with a keyboard while they can also control the assist character with the eye-tracker, solving puzzles and participating turn-based battles to save the magic school ""School Nocturnble"" from its curse. The game was developed with Unity 2019, Visual Studio 2019(C# code), and Tobii Unity SDK Version4. This game can be played in Windows PC and requires Tobii Eye Tracker5. The development of ""School Nocturnble"" focuses on providing new game mechanics for gamers who prefers various experience and contents.

590	GameSE_abstract	End-to-end SLA management in federated clouds	Cloud federation is a concept that collectively combines segregated cloud services to create an extended pool of resources for clouds to competently deliver their promised level of services. This paper studies the governing aspects of cloud federation through collaborative networking. It proposes a network of federated clouds, CloudLend, that creates a platform for cloud providers to collaborate, and for customers to expand their service selections. We design a service level agreement (SLA) management model to govern and administer the relationships between different cloud services. We define a multi-level SLA specification model to describe QoS terms, in addition to a game theory-based automated SLA negotiation model. We define an adaptive agent-based SLA monitoring model. Formal verification proved that our framework assures customers with maximum optimised QoS guarantees, in addition to supporting cloud providers to make informed resource utilisation decisions. Additionally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our SLA management model.

592	GameSE_abstract	Indirect innovation management by platform ecosystem governance and positioning: Toward collective ambidexterity in the ecosystems	This study outlines the implications of ecosystem governance and positioning regarding the indirect control of complementors? incremental and radical behaviors in goods development and successful innovations. The study tested how the degree of openness as an indicator of governance and the degree of distinctiveness as an indicator of the positioning influenced the direction and sales performance of complementary goods by employing 9,780 samples of Japanese video game software. The statistical results showed that an increase in both openness and distinctiveness facilitates radical-oriented behavior, while the sales of complementary goods rise as openness increases at the medium level of distinctiveness. Consequently, this study indicates that high openness and appropriate distinctiveness contribute to securing ambidexterity on the platform ecosystems to facilitate balanced software development and larger sales performance.

Middle-income countries such as Chile look atvideogamesand other service sectors as viable industries to promoteinthe context of their economies, which currently rely on high specialisationinthe extraction of natural resources and low value-added manufacturing products. However,aquestion must be asked: is thevideogamessectorinChileindanger of repeating similar patterns of dependency showed by those extractive-based industries? The following article explores this issue, deployingaLatin American dependency theory perspective combined with new insights from cognitive capitalism literature.

It owns several brands and a diversified portfolio of franchises.The client required a centralized vocabulary management software platform to provide standardized concepts across a decentralized, global organization to find, browse, and discover enterprise content. They needed the ability to push vocabularies out to consuming systems and users while also allowing users to suggest new concepts without requiring them to log in to the taxonomy and ontology management software.In addition to the out-of-the-box Graphite ontology management software functionality, the client required bespoke work in the system and dedicated API connectors which became part of the common code base for all versions going forward. Their requirements presented the opportunity for Synaptica to explore uses for the new specification, RDF-star (Arndt et al. 2021), in our implementation. As a new and developing specification in RDF graph databases, the use of RDF-star is groundbreaking work for commercial enterprise ontology management systems.

596	GameSE_abstract	Blockchain-based public ecosystem for auditing security of software applications	Over the years, software applications have captured a big market ranging from smart devices (smartphones, smart wearable devices) to enterprise resource management including Enterprise Resource Planning, office applications, and the entertainment industry (video games and graphics design applications). Protecting the copyright of software applications and protection from malicious software (malware) have been topics of utmost interest for academia and industry for many years. The standard solutions use the software license key or rely on the Operating System (OS) protection mechanisms, such as Google Play Protect. However, some end users have broken these protections to bypass payments for applications that are not free. They have done so by downloading the software from an unauthorised website or by jailbreaking the OS protection mechanisms. As a result, they cannot determine whether the software they download is malicious or not. Further, if the software is uploaded to a third party platform by malicious users, the software developer has no way of knowing about it. In such cases, the authenticity or integrity of the software cannot be guaranteed. There is also a problem of information transparency among software platforms. In this study, we propose an architecture that is based on blockchain technology for providing data transparency, release traceability, and auditability. Our goal is to provide an open framework to allow users, software vendors, and security practitioners to monitor misbehaviour and assess software vulnerabilities for preventing malicious software downloads. Specifically, the proposed solution makes it possible to identify software developers who have gone rogue and are potentially developing malicious software. Furthermore, we introduce an incentive policy for encouraging security engineers, victims and software owners to participate in collaborative works. The outcomes will ensure the wide adoption of a software auditing ecosystem in software markets, specifically for some mobile device manufacturers that have been banned from using the open-source OS such as Android. Consequently, there is a demand for them to verify the application security without completely relying on the OS-specific security mechanisms.

597	GameSE_abstract	Co-designing vacant lots using interactive 3D visualizations-Development and application of the Land.Info DSS	Collaborative processes of co-production between end-users and designers can be an effective means to produce shared understanding about a system and has been shown to improve the quality of, and support for, design outcomes. In spatial design and planning, co-production usually involves engaging community members in the design and planning of their local environment (co-design). However, to support co-design of landscapes it has been recommended that decision support systems (DSS) be developed for both the specific decision setting, and in conjunction with meaningful public guidance and input, to transition professional practice to working with rather than for the public. The research presented here responds to these recommendations by developing and evaluating a process for involving end user residents in the co-production and application of the Land.Info DSS in the design of multifunctional landscapes within their communities. The research used participatory workshops incorporating a structured elicitation process, agile software development, and user evaluation to design and test a video game-based DSS in context of two real-world design settings in Detroit, MI, USA. In this paper, we describe and evaluate the process and outcomes, with the results showing improved evaluation over the course of development and overall positive outcomes from this type of collaboration. We also found that residents required additional information to orient themselves in the DSS. In addition, visualization realism and ease of use of the DSS contributing to dialogue during co-design sessions. The paper ends with recommendations for future development and research.

600	GameSE_abstract	Dyconits: Scaling Minecraft-like Services through Dynamically Managed Inconsistency	Gaming is one of the most popular and lucrative entertainment industries. Minecraft alone exceeds 130 million active monthly players and sells millions of licenses annually; it is also provided as a (paid) service. Minecraft, and thousands of others, provide each a Modifiable Virtual Environment (MVE). However, Minecraft-like games only scale using isolated instances that support at most a few hundred players in the same virtual world, thus preventing their large player-base from actually gaming together. When operating as a service, even fewer players can game together. Existing techniques for managing data in distributed systems do not scale for such games: they either do not work for high-density areas (e.g., village centers or other places where the MVE is often modified), or can introduce an unbounded amount of inconsistency that can lower the quality of experience. In this work, we propose Dyconits, a middleware that allows games to scale, by bounding inconsistency in MVEs, optimistically and dynamically. Dyconits allow game developers to partition offline the game-world and its objects into units, each with its own bounds. The Dyconits system controls, dynamically and policy-based, the creation of dyconits and the management of their bounds. Importantly, the Dyconits system is thin, and reuses the existing game codebase and in particular the network stack. To demonstrate and evaluate Dyconits in practice, we modify an existing, open-source, Minecraft-like game, and evaluate its effectiveness through real-world experiments. Our approach supports up to 40% more concurrent players and reduces network bandwidth by up to 85%, with only minor modifications to the game and without increasing game latency.	dyconit; consistency; scalability; online gaming	Donkervliet, Jesse; Cuijpers, Jim; Iosup, Alexandru	2021 IEEE 41ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING SYSTEMS (ICDCS 2021)	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00021		126-137		Included	Included	new_screen			2	Web of Science	2021	Dyconits: Scaling Minecraft-like Services through Dynamically Managed Inconsistency	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00021	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

High level synthesis, HLS, is a technology that converts software into hardware automatically. Some power-hungry parts of game software are executed by high-speed and low-power hardware on the reconfigurable devices in the mobile terminals. To make an HLS tool generate a desirable hardware module, we must describe software program well considering the hardware organization. In previous study, we developed the software describing method for horizontal background scrolling. This method improved the performance of HLS hardware significantly. In this paper, we are going to propose software description method for omnidirectional background scrolling based on previous study. With this method, HLS tool may convert background scrolling processing efficiently. In addition, we also evaluate the execution time, resource usage and power consumption of the hardware module that HLS generated through experiment.	high-level synthesis; FPGA; background scrolling; game library	Lee, Kilryong; Yamawaki, Akira	2021 IEEE REGION 10 CONFERENCE (TENCON 2021)	https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON54134.2021.9707379		140-144		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen		Not related to Video Games: Studies that were not focused on software engineering applied to industry-scale computer games development.	2	Web of Science	2021	Omnidirectional Background Scrolling in High-Level Synthesis Oriented Game Programing Library	https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON54134.2021.9707379	IEEE	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

603	GameSE_abstract	CrowdRE in a Governmental Setting: Lessons from Two Case Studies	Crowd-based Requirements Engineering, or CrowdRE, is a recent paradigm that promotes the active participation of a large number of stakeholders in RE. In CrowdRE, requirements elicitation can be crowdsourced by creating an online platform that allows stakeholders to formulate ideas regarding the specific product. Although some case studies on crowd-based elicitation exist, no conclusive evidence can be derived on the effectiveness of such techniques. In this paper, we study crowd-based elicitation within a large governmental organization. We conduct two case studies of CrowdRE within the Royal Netherlands Nlarechaussee. For this, we construct the KMar-Crowd method, which adapts CrowdRE ideas to the needs of governmental organizations. While one case compares the crowd-generated ideas with requirements elicited via interviews and similar techniques, the other measures the usefulness of the gathered ideas for a product for which no prior elicitation was conducted. The results of the case studies, which attracted larger crowds than in previous studies. indicate that CrowdRE can be successfully applied to engage the users of a software product in requirements elicitation. Contradicting earlier studies, the inclusion of gamification elements in the CrowdRE method did not increase the motivation to participate, possibly due to the nature of governmental organizations.

604	GameSE_abstract	Advanced Interactive Style Guide for Design Consistency	A design initiative for advanced user interfaces began several years ago with the intent to provide design guidelines for new applications in the form of an interactive prototype toolkit called the User Interface Prototyping Toolkit (UIPT). The concept was to develop a tool that would allow sponsors, customers, end users, designers, engineers and software developers to work together in an iterative fashion to achieve a tailored user interface for the application of interest. An advanced or modern style was applied to the interface to provide a more current and modern look and feel to the user while still adhering to solid principle of design, workflow, tasks, layout, coloring, size, animated actions and user cues or alerts. An overarching goal was to design with a general repeatable structure. This allows each new project to understand what elements are used for and how the work within the user interface. This concept was further exploited by integrating multiple domains within in the same software application and leveraging the use of an end user's role to smoothly transition from the display from one user role to that of another. UIPT has been successfully integrated with over four projects and a series of user roles and the user interfaces associate with those roles. To maintain this design philosophy an interactive style guide began to be developed to apply design consistency across the multiple projects that utilize UIPT. This interactive style guide just happens to be built with Unity, a 2D and 3D game engine. This is the same tool used to prototype these user interfaces. As such the styles for size, color, layout and other design factors are laid out in an application which can be run to view and work with user interface element illustrated in the common design guide for the projects. Software developers obtain an advantage of having access to the code of the interactive style guide which contains not only how the code is to be implemented but contains the style specification already built into the code. This is advantageous as a means maintain design consistency, not having to repeat design and software development for a majority of the user interface. Additionally, new software developers and designers are provided with a solid template which helps in bring them up to speed at an accelerated rate.

605	GameSE_abstract	Implementing game requirements using design patterns	Gamemechanics are high-level descriptions of commongamerequirements; however, they do not provide any guidance on their code implementation. Nevertheless, their implementation involves high volumes of essential complexity, which in turn leads to the introduction of accidental complexity (long methods, code repetition, etc.). A possible solution to this problem is to mapgamemechanics todesignpatterns, in order to provide template instantiations that handle structural complexity. The aim of this study is twofold: (a) introduce template instantiations ofgamemechanics with Gang of Four (GoF)patternsand (b) evaluate such mappings in terms of extendibility and reusability. To achieve these objectives, we developed an online repository of mappings between GoFpatternsandgamemechanics and conducted an experiment to explore the benefits of the mapping. The results of the study suggest that the implementation ofgamemechanics with GoFpatternsis beneficial, because the time to extent the current implementation or reuse code chunks is not prolonged, whereas the implementations are less faulty. Finally, the suggested mapping will equipgamemechanics with sample implementations (that adhere to gooddesignprinciples-ensuring extendibility) that can be reused, acting as a starting point for source code development.	designpatterns; gamemechanics; maintainability; reusability	Paschali, Maria-Eleni; Volioti, Christina; Ampatzoglou, Apostolos; Gkagkas, Anastasios; Stamelos, Ioannis; Chatzigeorgiou, Alexander	JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE-EVOLUTION AND PROCESS	https://doi.org/10.1002/smr.2399				Included	Excluded	new_screen		Not related to Video Games: Studies that were not focused on software engineering applied to industry-scale computer games development.	2	Web of Science	2021	Implementing game requirements using design patterns	https://doi.org/10.1002/smr.2399	WILEY	nan; References; Pages; Year; Bibtex; Link
606	GameSE_abstract	On the comprehension of application programming interface usability in game engines	Extensive development of games for various purposes including education and entertainment has resulted in increased development of game engines. Game engines are being used on a large scale as they support and simplify game development to a greater extent. Game developers using game engines are often compelled to use various application programming interfaces (APIs) of game engines in the process of game development. Thus, both quality and ease of development of games are greatly influenced by APIs defined in game engines. Hence, understanding API usability in game engines could greatly help in choosing better game engines among the ones that are available for game development and also could help developers in designing better game engines. In this article, we thus aim to evaluate API usability of 95 publicly available game engine repositories on GitHub, written primarily in C++ programming language. We test API usability of these game engines against the eight structural API usability metrics-AMNOI, AMNCI, AMGI, APXI, APLCI, AESI, ATSI, and ADI. We see this research as a first step toward the direction of improving usability of APIs in game engines. We present the results of the study, which indicate that about 25% of the game engines considered have minimal API usability, with respect to the considered metrics. It was observed that none of the considered repositories have ideal (all metric scores equal to 1) API usability, indicating the need for developers to consider API usability metrics while designing game engines.

607	GameSE_abstract	Screenomics: A Framework to Capture and Analyze Personal Life Experiences and the Ways that Technology Shapes Them	"Digital experiences capture an increasingly large part of life, making them a preferred, if not required, method to describe and theorize about human behavior. Digital media also shape behavior by enabling people to switch between different content easily, and create unique threads of experiences that pass quickly through numerous information categories. Current methods of recording digital experiences provide only partial reconstructions of digital lives that weave - often within seconds - among multiple applications, locations, functions, and media. We describe an end-to-end system for capturing and analyzing the ""screenome"" of life in media, i.e., the record of individual experiences represented as a sequence of screens that people view and interact with over time. The system includes software that collects screenshots, extracts text and images, and allows searching of a screenshot database. We discuss how the system can be used to elaborate current theories about psychological processing of technology, and suggest new theoretical questions that are enabled by multiple timescale analyses. Capabilities of the system are highlighted with eight research examples that analyze screens from adults who have generated data within the system. We end with a discussion of future uses, limitations, theory, and privacy."		Reeves, Byron; Ram, Nilam; Robinson, Thomas N.; Cummings, James J.; Giles, C.

608	GameSE_abstract	Digital Work, Disposable Work? When Opportunities to Explore Threaten the Meaning of the Activity	This chapter points out the ambivalence of video game workers towards their digital, creative and collective work. It exposes the mode of division of this complex digital work, and shows the possibilities of exploration and management of its contingencies offered to the employees by the chronic indeterminacy of the manufactured product. While the primacy of contingencies may be associated with moments of exploration and creative projection, the prevalence of iterative development processes is also likely to threaten the very possibility of engaging in the activity. The activity of video game assemblers will offer us the typical case of a system of activity where the digital nature of the product increases the possibilities of individual and collective exploration tenfold, while subjecting the work experience to a constant regime of contingencies. The chapter shows that its digital nature, by allowing multiple iterations, also feeds the fear of disposable work and may weaken their commitment to the work.

610	GameSE_abstract	Minimizing Play Request Rejection through Workload Splitting in Edge-Cloud Gaming	Cloud gaming abstracts the concept of traditional gaming and places the gaming activities on remote rendering servers (RSes). Although this allows heterogeneous devices to gain access to multiple game titles, latency issue is always unavoidable. Each game input must go through a complete round trip between the player's device and the cloud gaming server. Hence, cloud games are not as responsive as traditional computer games where the game logic runs locally. Moreover, in order to have an acceptable level of game playability, the latency level must be within a certain threshold. This also prevents some players who are located in remote regions from playing the game due to high latency. Therefore, in this paper, we employ edge servers in order to reach those players by activating lower capability RSes which are more geographically distributed. Furthermore, we also allow workload splitting of foreground and background rendering between edge and cloud RSes to ease the burden of each individual RS with a trade-off between cost and latency constraints. From our experiments, our architecture and allocation scheme results in reduction of play request rejections for up to 28% compared to traditional cloud gaming approach.

611	GameSE_abstract	'Never Imagined I Would Work In The Digital Game Industry'	"The deep gender gap present in the digital games sector can be seen as a revealing function of gendered spaces. As such, it is essential to analyze the genderization's micro-processes in these specific contexts. This paper will explore the possible causes of female under-representation in the gaming sector through data collected in the qualitative research conducted with students and professionals employed in the Portuguese gaming industry. This study's main aim was to identify the factors that condition the professional (non) choice in Portugal's digital games area and how these differ according to the individual's gender. We conducted empirical research with students and professionals in Portugal's digital games sector, namely focus groups with students and interviews with professionals. In presenting and discussing the data, we prioritized the participants' narratives, using excerpts to illustrate the chosen analysis categories. In the analytical process, it was possible to identify that the professional (non)choice in digital games goes through the contact with video games since childhood, the experience of creating their games before entering college, family influence, and differs according to the gender. The results of this research suggest at least three different fallacies: 1) the fallacy of programming; 2) the fallacy of digital games' ""unviability""; 3) and the fallacy of digital games as a gendered artifact. Overall, this study offers a contextualized analysis of the processes and practices that result in (and produce) gender inequalities in the digital gaming industry, specifically how these inequalities impact career (non) choice."

612	GameSE_abstract	UtopicSense: a tool to support the use of synesthesia as an assistive resource in 2D games	The concept of synesthesia in games comprises providing stimuli in more than one sense, such as displaying visual effects concurrently with sound effects on a screen. Algorithmic synesthesia is a concept that describes multimedia processes in which sounds, images, and in some cases, haptic sensations have as generators the same computational process or data source. Game developers can leverage such concept as an ancillary resource for people with hearing loss or deafness. Despite its advantages to the gaming experience, synesthesia is rarely contemplated in gaming design with the focus on accessibility. This situation usually happens because developers are unaware of its benefits or want to avoid additional costs and more implementation work on the project's schedule. This paper presents UtopicSense, a tool that automates implementing synesthesia in 2D games inside Unity. To create it, we identified positive and negative accessibility aspects perceived through the analysis of 2D games. We then developed the tool which allows users to configure aspects of the generated visual effects through a Unity custom editor panel. We evaluated the tool in terms of usability with potential users (Unity game developers). They provided feedback and evaluated the tool in terms of ease of use, flexibility, and usefulness. Participants expressed positive reactions towards UtopicSense and indicated that it fulfilled its goal of integrating algorithmic synesthesia into 2D games in an easier way.	algorithmic synesthesia; game accessibility; hearing impairment; deafness; unity	Germano Silva, Adriel Augusto; dos Santos Coutinho, Flavio Roberto	2021 20TH BRAZILIAN SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER GAMES AND DIGITAL ENTERTAINMENT (SBGAMES 2021)	https://doi.org/10.1109/SBGames54170.2021.00031		191-200		Included	Excluded	new_screen		Not related to Video Games: Studies that were not focused on software engineering applied to industry-scale computer games development.	2	Web of Science	2021	UtopicSense: a tool to support the use of synesthesia as an assistive resource in 2D games	https://doi.org/10.1109/SBGames54170.2021.00031	IEEE	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
613	GameSE_abstract	Seeing Through Walls: Real-Time Digital Twin Modeling of Indoor Spaces	"As the need for situational awareness rises in search and rescue tasks, systems for human spatial sensing augmentation in complex-built environments has become increasingly important. Sensor-based mapping and augmented reality (AR) techniques have been tested to provide enhanced visual assistance in indoor scenarios, such as ""seeing through walls"" abilities for occluded areas. Scholars have examined various scanning techniques and UI/UX designs for AR-based occlusion visualization. However, evidence is still needed to show how scene capturing, 3D mapping, rendering and visualization can be executed integratively, enabling an instantaneous ""Digital Twins"" modeling. This paper presents a robot-based system for mapping indoor environments and creating a near real-time virtual replica. A dynamically updated 3D map rendered with Unity generates egocentric ""x-ray vision"" views of the occluded objects using AR headsets. A case study was performed in a lab room, resulting in virtual regeneration of surroundings supporting search and rescue in occluded areas."

616	GameSE_abstract	Introduction of a process maturity model for market‐driven product management and requirements engineering	SUMMARY The area of software product development of software intensive products has received much attention, especially in the area of requirements engineering and product management. Many companies are faced with new challenges when operating in an environment where potential requirements number in thousands or even tens of thousands, and where a product does not have a customer, but any number of customers or markets. The development organization carries not only all the costs of development, but also takes all the risks. In this environment traditional bespoke requirements engineering, together with traditional process assessment and improvement models fall short as they do not address the unique challenges of a market-driven environment. This paper introduces the Market-driven Requirements Engineering Process Model, aimed at enabling process improvement and process assurance for organizations faced with these new challenges. The model is also validated in the industry through three case studies where the model is used for process assessment and improvement suggestion. Initial results show that the model is appropriate for process improvement for organizations operating in a market-driven environment. In addition, the model was designed to be light weight in terms of low cost and thus adapted not only for large organizations but suitable for small and medium enterprises as well.

617	GameSE_abstract	Analysis of interrater agreement in ISO/IEC 15504-based software process assessment	"The emerging ISO/IEC 15504 standard provides a framework and a model for software process assessment and improvement. There are two requirements for reliable process assessment: internal reliability and external reliability. The objective of the study is to provide an empirical case of external reliability, i.e. the interrater agreement in ISO/IEC 15504-based software process assessment. Interrater agreement implies the extent to which independent assessors agree in their ratings of software process attributes. Our dataset was from two assessments conducted using the ISO/IEC 15504 standard. The results showed ""substantial"" to ""excellent"" agreement. This implies that the two assessments acquired external reliability."

618	GameSE_abstract	Software Development Processes for Games: A Systematic Literature Review	This paper describes the methodology and results from a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the software processes used in game development. A total of 404 papers were analyzed as part of the review and the various process models that are used in industry and academia/research are presented. Software Process Improvement (SPI) initiatives for game development are discussed. The factors that promote or deter the adoption of process models, and implementing SPI in practice are highlighted. Our findings indicate that there is no single model that serves as a best practice process model for game development and it is a matter of deciding which model is best suited for a particular game. Agile models such as Scrum and XP are suited to the knowledge intensive domain of game development where innovation and speed to market are vital. Hybrid approaches such as reuse can also be suitable for game development where the risk of the upfront investment in terms of time and cost is mitigated with a game that has stable requirements and a longer lifespan.

619	GameSE_abstract	An organizational maturity model of software product line engineering	Software product line engineering is an inter-disciplinary concept. It spans the dimensions of business, architecture, process, and the organization. Some of the potential benefits of this approach include cost reduction, improvements in product quality and a decrease in product development time. The increasing popularity of software product line engineering in the software industry necessitates a process maturity evaluation methodology. Accordingly, this paper presents an organizational maturity model of software product line engineering for evaluating the maturity of organizational dimension. The model assumes that organizational theories, behavior, and management play a critical role in the institutionalization of software product line engineering within an organization. Assessment questionnaires and a rating methodology comprise the framework of this model. The objective and design of the questionnaires are to collect information about the software product line engineering process from the dual perspectives of organizational behavior and management. Furthermore, we conducted two case studies and reported the assessment results using the organizational maturity model presented in this paper.

Inopensourceprojects,usabilityaspects cannot be improved unless there are ways to test and measure them. Hence, the increasing popularity ofopensourceprojects among novice and non-technical users necessitates ausabilityevaluation methodology. Consequently, this paper presents ausabilitymaturitymodelspecifically aimed atusability-related issues foropensourceprojects. In particular, themodelexamines the degree of coordination betweenopensourceprojects and theirusabilityaspects. The measuring instrument of themodelcontains factors that have been selected from four of our empirical studies, which examine the perspectives of OSS users, developers, contributors and the industry. In addition to presenting theusabilitymaturitymodel, this paper discusses assessment questionnaires, a rating methodology and two case studies.

622	GameSE_abstract	A systematic mapping study on serious game quality	Context:A Serious Game (SG) is a game for purposes other than entertainment [12]. SGs are currently in widespread use and their popularity has begun to steadily increase; their application areas now extend not only to education, but also to military, health and corporate [9] [12] sectors. SGs are of vital importance at present, as they can be a means to achieve relevant goals from both a personal and an institutional point of view. This may take place in fields as diverse as defense, education, scientific exploration, health care, emergency management, city planning, engineering, religion, and politics. The number of users of these systems grows each day, signifying that their impact is very high, and it is precisely for this reason that more extensive research on SG quality is needed.

624	GameSE_abstract	Empirical analysis of user data in game software development	For several years empirical studies have spanned the spectrum of research from software productivity, quality, reliability, performance to human computer interaction. Analyses have involved software systems ranging from desktop software to telecommunication switching systems. But surprising there has been little work done on the emerging digital game industry, one of the fastest growing domains today. To the best of our knowledge, our work is one of the first empirical analysis of a large commercially successful game system. In this paper, we introduce an analysis of the significant user data generated in the gaming industry by using a successful game: Project Gotham Racing 4.More specifically, due to the increasing ubiquity of constantly connected high-speed internet connections for game consoles, developers are able to collect extensive amounts of data about their games following release. The challenge now is to make sense of that data, and from it be able to make recommendations to developers. This paper presents an empirical case study analyzing the data collected from a released game over a three year period. The results of this analysis include a better understanding of the differences between long-term and short-term players, and the extent to which various options in the game are utilized. This led to recommendations for future development ways to reduce development costs and to keep new players engaged. A secondary goal for this paper is to introduce software game development as a topic of importance to the empirical software engineering community and discuss research results on a key difference area: data analytics on user data to customize user and development experiences.	game design;  game development;  game metrics	Hullett, Kenneth; Nagappan, Nachiappan; Schuh, Eric; Hopson, John	ESEM '12: Proceedings of the ACM-IEEE international symposium on Empirical software engineering and measurement	https://doi.org/10.1145/2372251.2372265		89-98	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2372251.2372265,

625	GameSE_abstract	MMORPG player behavior model based on player action categories	In this paper we present the modeling of player behavior for Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs). We have performed action specific measurements of player sessions in terms of the previously defined action categories for MMORPGs (Trading, Questing, Dungeons, Raiding, and Player versus Player Combat). We explore the hourly trends in user behavior and form models based on observed patterns. We explore the session duration as well as lengths and probability of session segments (i.e., parts of the session consisting of only one category of player actions). Our aim is to create the user behavior model and to combine it with previously established traffic models in order to be able to explain, predict, and generate network traffic of MMORPGs more accurately. As a case study we use World of Warcraft.

627	GameSE_abstract	Churn Prediction in MMORPGs: A Social Influence Based Approach	Massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) are computer based games in which players interact with one another in the virtual world. Worldwide revenues for MMORPGs have seen amazing growth in last few years and it is more than a 2 billion dollars industry as per current estimates. Huge amount of revenue potential has attracted several gaming companies to launch online role playing games. One of the major problems these companies suffer apart from fierce competition is erosion of their customer base. Churn is a big problem for the gaming companies as churners impact negatively in the word of-mouth reports for potential and existing customers leading to further erosion of user base.We study the problem of player churn in the popular MMORPG EverQuest II. The problem of churn prediction has been studied extensively in the past in various domains and social network analysis has recently been applied to the problem to understand the effects of the strength of social ties and the structure and dynamics of a social network in churn. In this paper, we propose a churn prediction model based on examining social influence among players and their personal engagement in the game. We hypothesize that social influence is a vector quantity, with components negative influence and positive influence. We propose a modified diffusion model to propagate the influence vector in the players network which represents the social influence on the player from his network. We measure a players personal engagement based on his activity patterns and use it in the modified diffusion model and churn prediction. Our method for churn prediction which combines social influence and player engagement factors has shown to improve prediction accuracy significantly for our dataset as compared to prediction using the conventional diffusion model or the player engagement factor, thus validating our hypothesis that combination of both these factors could lead to a more accurate churn prediction.

629	GameSE_abstract	Why MMORPG players do what they do: Relating motivations to action categories	This paper presents an analysis of relations between player motivation and behavior in a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG). Player motivation is measured in terms of percentile ranks of motivational components for MMORPG players defined by Nick Yee. Player behavior is described through previously defined action categories for MMORPGs (Trading, Questing, Dungeons, Raiding, Player versus Player Combat, and Communication). We conduct a player survey and perform measurements on the client side for a group of 104 players of World of Warcraft. Additionally we examine the importance of both voice and textual communication in MMORPGs.

630	GameSE_abstract	Understanding the efficiency of ray traversal on GPUs	We discuss the mapping of elementary ray tracing operations---acceleration structure traversal and primitive intersection---onto wide SIMD/SIMT machines. Our focus is on NVIDIA GPUs, but some of the observations should be valid for other wide machines as well. While several fast GPU tracing methods have been published, very little is actually understood about their performance. Nobody knows whether the methods are anywhere near the theoretically obtainable limits, and if not, what might be causing the discrepancy. We study this question by comparing the measurements against a simulator that tells the upper bound of performance for a given kernel. We observe that previously known methods are a factor of 1.5--2.5X off from theoretical optimum, and most of the gap is not explained by memory bandwidth, but rather by previously unidentified inefficiencies in hardware work distribution. We then propose a simple solution that significantly narrows the gap between simulation and measurement. This results in the fastest GPU ray tracer to date. We provide results for primary, ambient occlusion and diffuse interreflection rays.	ray tracing;  SIMT;  SIMD	Aila, Timo; Laine, Samuli	HPG '09: Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Graphics 2009	https://doi.org/10.1145/1572769.1572792		145-149	"@inproceedings{10.1145/1572769.1572792,

634	GameSE_abstract	On the impacts of human interactions in MMORPG traffic	Game traffic depends on two main factors, the game protocol and the gamers' behavior. Based on a few popular real-time multiplayer games this paper investigates the latter factor showing how a set of typical game phases - e.g., player movement, changes in the environment-impacts traffic on different observation levels. The nature of human behavior has such a high impact on traffic characteristics that it influences the traffic both at a macroscopic - e.g., traffic rate-and at a microscopic - payload content - level. First, by understanding the nature of this impact a user behavior detection algorithm is introduced to grab specific events and states from passive traffic measurements. The algorithms focus on the characteristics of the traffic rate, showing what information can be gathered by observing only packet header information. Second, as an application of our method some results, including a detailed analysis of measurements taken from an operational broadband network, are presented. Third, a novel model and an algorithm are introduced to extend the Deep Packet Inspection traffic classification method with the analysis of non-fix byte signatures, which are not considered in current methods. The model captures the variation of the dynamic byte segments and provides parameters for the algorithm. The introduced algorithm exploits the spatial and temporal correlation by examining and extracting the correlation structure of the traffic and constructing signatures based on the observed correlation. The algorithm is evaluated by examining proprietary gaming traffic and also other known non-gaming protocols.

Our approach supports a large number of volumes, complex translucent and concave polyhedral objects as well as CSG intersections of volumes and geometry in any combination. The system (including the rasterization stage) is implemented entirely in CUDA, which allows full control of the memory hierarchy, in particular access to high bandwidth and low latency shared memory. High depth complexity, which is problematic for conventional approaches based on depth peeling, can be handled successfully.

636	GameSE_abstract	Whippletree: Task-based scheduling of dynamic workloads on the GPU	(Figure Presented) In this paper, we present Whippletree, a novel approach to scheduling dynamic, irregular workloads on the GPU. We introduce a new programming model which offers the simplicity and expressiveness of task-based parallelism while retaining all aspects of the multi-level execution hierarchy essential to unlocking the full potential of a modern GPU. At the same time, our programming model lends itself to efficient implementation on the SIMD-based architecture typical of a current GPU. We demonstrate the practical utility of our model by providing a reference implementation on top of current CUDA hardware. Furthermore, we show that our model compares favorably to traditional approaches in terms of both performance as well as the range of applications that can be covered.

We introduce a new programming model which offers the simplicity and expressiveness of task-based parallelism while retaining all aspects of the multi-level execution hierarchy essential to unlocking the full potential of a modern GPU. At the same time, our programming model lends itself to efficient implementation on the SIMD-based architecture typical of a current GPU. We demonstrate the practical utility of our model by providing a reference implementation on top of current CUDA hardware. Furthermore, we show that our model compares favorably to traditional approaches in terms of both performance as well as the range of applications that can be covered. We demonstrate the benefits of our model for recursive Reyes rendering, procedural geometry generation and volume rendering with concurrent irradiance caching. Copyright (c) ACM."",

638	GameSE_abstract	Motivation and multimodal interaction in model-driven educational game design	In this correspondence, we present an approach to identifying and constructing profiles of user interfaces for educational games. Our approach is based on framing games as educational tools that incorporate fun and learning through motivation as the key ingredient in the learning process and multimodal interaction as the medium for conveying educational material. The proposed solution formalizes the design process, describing educational games in terms of estimated effects that they produce on players. Building upon research on learning and motivation theory, we are connecting these effects with player learning preferences and motivation states. The essence of our solution is the educational game metamodel (EGM), which defines platform-independent educational game concepts. Using the EGM, we have explored novel design approaches for educational games. The metamodel can be used as a conceptual basis for creation of platform-independent educational games, allowing authoring for device and network independence.

639	GameSE_abstract	MAM-UML: an UML profile for the modeling of mobile-agent applications	This paper introduces an approach for the modeling of mobile-agent applications. It aims to deal with the lack of appropriate concepts and notations, in the standard UML, to capture relevant abstractions for the modeling of mobile-agent features. The approach is materialized by an UML profile, which includes views to model organizational, life cycle, interaction and mobility aspects of mobile-agent applications contributing to the analysis, design and implementation phases of their development.

641	GameSE_abstract	Level design as model transformation: a strategy for automated content generation	This paper frames the process of designing a level in a game as a series of model transformations. The transformations correspond to the application of particular design principles, such as the use of locks and keys to transform a linear mission into a branching space. It shows that by using rewrite systems, these transformations can be formalized and automated. The resulting automated process is highly controllable: it is a perfect match for a mixed-initiative approach to level generation where human and computer collaborate in designing levels. An experimental prototype that implements these ideas is presented.

642	GameSE_abstract	Analysis of World of Warcraft traffic patterns and user behavior	Internet traffic measurements are necessary in order to both understand how the Internet is used and how new applications may affect the networks. World of Warcraft (WoW) is currently the most popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) with more than 11 million subscribers worldwide. In this paper, we present WoW results from traffic measurements performed in a Swedish commercial broadband access network. The data was obtained with deep packet and flow inspections using a commercial traffic monitoring tool. Data was collected during a 4 months period. The objective of the measurements was to analyze World of Warcraft traffic patterns and user behavior. We show weekly traffic patterns, session duration analyses, and traffic rate distributions. Also, we show how World of Warcraft usage varies depending on the households' broadband access rates.

643	GameSE_abstract	Hack, Slash, and Chat: A study of players' behavior and communication in MMORPGs	This paper presents an analysis of player behavior in a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG). We examine player behavior in terms of when, how much, and what they do in the virtual world. Player behavior is described through previously defined action categories for MMORPGs (Trading, Questing, Dungeons, Raiding, and Player versus Player (PvP) Combat) with addition of a new category for text and voice communication within a session. We conduct a player survey and perform measurements on the client side for a group of 104 players of a popular MMORPG - World of Warcraft (WoW), and discover that there are significant patterns in player behavior. Additionally we examine the importance of both voice and textual (chat) communication in MMORPGs, and note that communication makes a significant portion of average player's playtime and that voice communication is used by a large portion of players. We believe that the results of this study may be used for improving the existing and design of new MMORPGs (e.g., building better load balancing algorithms, addition of content that is more interesting for players) with more emphasis on both old and new communication aspects of the game (e.g., inbuilt voice clients, new ways of connecting the players). This work also serves as a starting point for better insight into networking requirements for such applications, which may be useful for service and network providers.

645	GameSE_abstract	World of warcraft avatar history dataset	From the perspective of game system designers, players' behavior is one of the most important factors they must consider when designing game systems. To gain a fundamental understanding of the game play behavior of online gamers, exploring users' game play time provides a good starting point. This is because the concept of game play time is applicable to all genres of games and it enables us to model the system workload as well as the impact of system and network QoS on users' behavior. It can even help us predict players' loyalty to specific games. In this paper, we present the World of Warcraft Avatar History (WoWAH) dataset, which comprises the records of 91,065 avatars. The data includes the avatars' game play times and a number of attributes, such as their race, profession, current level, and in-game locations, during a 1,107-day period between Jan. 2006 and Jan. 2009. We believe the WOWAH dataset could be used for various creative purposes, now that it is a public asset of the research community.

646	GameSE_abstract	On-the-fly vertex reuse for massively-parallel software geometry processing	Due to its flexibility, compute mode is becoming more and more attractive as a way to implement many of the algorithms part of a state-of-the-art rendering pipeline. A key problem commonly encountered in graphics applications is streaming vertex and geometry processing. In a typical triangle mesh, the same vertex is on average referenced six times. To avoid redundant computation during rendering, a post-transform cache is traditionally employed to reuse vertex processing results. However, such a vertex cache can generally not be implemented efficiently in software and does not scale well as parallelism increases. We explore alternative strategies for reusing per-vertex results on-the-fly during massively-parallel software geometry processing. Given an input stream divided into batches, we analyze the effectiveness of sorting, hashing, and intra-thread-group communication for identifying and exploiting local reuse potential. We design and present four vertex reuse strategies tailored to modern GPU architectures. We demonstrate that, in a variety of applications, these strategies not only achieve effective reuse of vertex processing results, but can boost performance by up to 2-3 compared to a naive approach. Curiously, our experiments also show that our batch-based approaches exhibit behavior similar to the OpenGL implementation on current graphics hardware.

647	GameSE_abstract	Megakernels considered harmful: wavefront path tracing on GPUs	When programming for GPUs, simply porting a large CPU program into an equally large GPU kernel is generally not a good approach. Due to SIMT execution model on GPUs, divergence in control flow carries substantial performance penalties, as does high register us-age that lessens the latency-hiding capability that is essential for the high-latency, high-bandwidth memory system of a GPU. In this paper, we implement a path tracer on a GPU using a wavefront formulation, avoiding these pitfalls that can be especially prominent when using materials that are expensive to evaluate. We compare our performance against the traditional megakernel approach, and demonstrate that the wavefront formulation is much better suited for real-world use cases where multiple complex materials are present in the scene.	path tracing;  complex materials;  GPU	Laine, Samuli; Karras, Tero; Aila, Timo	HPG '13: Proceedings of the 5th High-Performance Graphics Conference	https://doi.org/10.1145/2492045.2492060		137-143	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2492045.2492060,

    abstract = ""When programming for GPUs, simply porting a large CPU program into an equally large GPU kernel is generally not a good approach. Due to SIMT execution model on GPUs, divergence in control flow carries substantial performance penalties, as does high register us-age that lessens the latency-hiding capability that is essential for the high-latency, high-bandwidth memory system of a GPU. In this paper, we implement a path tracer on a GPU using a wavefront formulation, avoiding these pitfalls that can be especially prominent when using materials that are expensive to evaluate. We compare our performance against the traditional megakernel approach, and demonstrate that the wavefront formulation is much better suited for real-world use cases where multiple complex materials are present in the scene."",

649	GameSE_abstract	MMORPG player behavior model based on player action categories	In this paper we present the modeling of player behavior for Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs). We have performed action specific measurements of player sessions in terms of the previously defined action categories for MMORPGs (Trading, Questing, Dungeons, Raiding, and Player versus Player Combat). We explore the hourly trends in user behavior and form models based on observed patterns. We explore the session duration as well as lengths and probability of session segments (i.e., parts of the session consisting of only one category of player actions). Our aim is to create the user behavior model and to combine it with previously established traffic models in order to be able to explain, predict, and generate network traffic of MMORPGs more accurately. As a case study we use World of Warcraft.

650	GameSE_abstract	Transformation approach to model online gaming traffic	In this paper, we propose a transformation scheme used to analyze online gaming traffic properties and develop a traffic model. We analyze the packet size and the inter departure time distributions of a popular first-person shooter game (Left 4 Dead) and a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (World of Warcraft) in order to compare them to the existing scheme. Recent online gaming traffic is erratically distributed, so it is very difficult to analyze. Therefore, our research focuses on a transformation scheme to obtain new smooth patterns from a messy dataset. It extracts relatively heavy-weighted density data and then transforms them into a corresponding dataset domain to obtain a simplified graph. We compare the analytical model histogram, the chi-square statistic, and the quantile-quantile plot of the proposed scheme to an existing scheme. The results show that the proposed scheme demonstrates a good fit in all parts. The chi-square statistic of our scheme for the Left 4 Dead packet size distribution is less than one ninth of the existing one when dealing with erratic traffic.

Unlike previous approaches, we obey ordering constraints imposed by current graphics APIs, guarantee hole-free rasterization, and support multisample antialiasing. Our goal is to examine the performance implications of not exploiting the fixed-function graphics pipeline, and to discern which additional hardware support would benefit software-based graphics the most.

We analyzed the packet size and inter departure time distributions of a popular FPS game (Left4Dead) and MMORPG (World of Warcraft) for regenerating gaming traffic. The proposed traffic generator generates an inter departure time and gaming packetbased on analytical model of the gamer behaviors, then transmits the packet according to the inter departure time. Packet generation results show that generated packets of World of Warcraft is much different with analytical model, unlike Left4Dead. It is caused by Nagle algorithm and Delayed Acknowledgments of TCP. Thus, we disabled the Nagle algorithm in the proposed traffic generator. The generation results show that the revised proposed traffic generator guarantees goodness of fit in the generated traffic distribution.

654	GameSE_abstract	Is Server Consolidation Beneficial to MMORPG? A Case Study of World of Warcraft	MMORPG is shown to be a killer application of Internet, with a global subscriber number increased to 17 millions in 2010. However, MMORPG servers tend to be overly provisioned because 1)such games do not have standard architectures thus dedicated hardware is assumed; 2) MMORPGs normally adopt a ``sharded design'' to resolve the scalability challenges of content production and workload distribution; and 3) a game is commonly deployed in geographically distributed data centers to protect gamers from excessive network latencies. Therefore, an operator needs to deploy dedicated hardware for each game in each datacenter, even though hardware utilization is low. In this paper, we propose a zone-based server consolidation strategy for MMORPGs, which exploits the unique locality property of players' interactions, to cut down the games' considerable hardware requirement and energy use. We evaluate the effectiveness of our strategy based on a nine-month trace from a popular MMORPG World of War craft. The evaluation results show that, with a per-hour dynamic zone reallocation policy, the server number required can be reduced by 52% and the total energy consumption can be reduced by 62%, while the user-experienced latency remains undegraded.

655	GameSE_abstract	GRAMPS: A programming model for graphics pipelines	We introduce GRAMPS, a programming model that generalizes concepts from modern real-time graphics pipelines by exposing a model of execution containing both fixed-function and application-programmable processing stages that exchange data via queues. GRAMPS allows the number, type, and connectivity of these processing stages to be defined by software, permitting arbitrary processing pipelines or even processing graphs. Applications achieve high performance using GRAMPS by expressing advanced rendering algorithms as custom pipelines, then using the pipeline as a rendering engine. We describe the design of GRAMPS, then evaluate it by implementing three pipelines, that is, Direct3D, a ray tracer, and a hybridization of the two, and running them on emulations of two different GRAMPS implementations: a traditional GPU-like architecture and a CPU-like multicore architecture. In our tests, our GRAMPS schedulers run our pipelines with 500 to 1500KB of queue usage at their peaks.

656	GameSE_abstract	An Agent-Based Simulation of Farmer's Behaviors Adapting to Ecological Policies Using NetLogo	Agent-based simulation, a methodology based on Complex Adaptive System (CAS) theory, is considered to be a new approach to research the farmer's behaviors adapting to ecological policies. Based on the analysis that the farmer is a complex system, we classified them into five kinds. This paper used NetLogo software to simulate how financial subsidies affect their behavior change. The results show that when financial subsidies increase the farmer's income largely, the proportion of those violate the policies will reduce significantly by 96.2%, and when financial subsidies decrease the income largely, the proportion of those who obey the policies will reduce significantly by 97.9%.

657	GameSE_abstract	Parallel Adaptive Frameless Rendering with NVIDIA OptiX	In virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) systems, latency is one of the most important causes of simulator sickness. Latency is difficult to limit in traditional renderers, which sample time rigidly with a series of frames, each representing a single moment in time, depicted with a fixed amount of latency. Previous researchers proposed adaptive frameless rendering (AFR), which removes frames to sample space and time flexibly, and reduce latency. However, their prototype was neither parallel nor interactive. We implement AFR in NVIDIA OptiX, a concurrent, real-time ray tracing API taking advantage of NVIDIA GPUs, including their latest RTX ray tracing components. With proper tuning, our prototype prioritizes temporal detail when scenes are dynamic (producing rapidly updated, blurry imagery), and spatial detail when scenes are static (producing more slowly updated, sharp imagery). The result is parallel, interactive, low-latency imagery that should reduce simulator sickness.	ray tracing;  adaptive frameless rendering;  Nvidia OptiX	Hsiao, Chung-Che; Watson, Benjamin	ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)	https://doi.org/10.1145/3355056.3364569		1-2	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3355056.3364569,

658	GameSE_abstract	The effectiveness and efficiency of model driven game design	In order for techniques from Model Driven Engineering to be accepted at large by the game industry, it is critical that the effectiveness and efficiency of these techniques are proven for game development. There is no lack of game design models, but there is no model that has surfaced as an industry standard. Game designers are often reluctant to work with models: they argue these models do not help them design games and actually restrict their creativity. At the same time, the flexibility that model driven engineering allows seems a good fit for the fluidity of the game design process, while clearly defined, generic models can be used to develop automated design tools that increase the development's efficiency.

Its features are first described. We believe that some capabilities are in fact innovative, since no other traffic generator offers them. Then, we describe the original architecture of D-ITG, which allows our traffic generator to achieve high performance. We hint at a comparison with other traffic generators and conclude with the ongoing work to add new features.

661	GameSE_abstract	Piko: A framework for authoring programmable graphics pipelines	We present Piko, a framework for designing, optimizing, and retargeting implementations of graphics pipelines on multiple architectures. Piko programmers express a graphics pipeline by organizing the computation within each stage into spatial bins and specifying a scheduling preference for these bins. Our compiler, Pikoc, compiles this input into an optimized implementation targeted to a massively-parallel GPU or a multicore CPU. Piko manages work granularity in a programmable and flexible manner, allowing programmers to build load-balanced parallel pipeline implementations, to exploit spatial and producer-consumer locality in a pipeline implementation, and to explore tradeoffs between these considerations. We demonstrate that Piko can implement a wide range of pipelines, including rasterization, Reyes, ray tracing, rasterization/ ray tracing hybrid, and deferred rendering. Piko allows us to implement efficient graphics pipelines with relative ease and to quickly explore design alternatives by modifying the spatial binning configurations and scheduling preferences for individual stages, all while delivering real-time performance that is within a factor six of state-of-the-art rendering systems.

662	GameSE_abstract	Applying the MDA approach for the automatic generation of an MVC2 web application	The web applications propose to the users various practical functionalities. Among these there are the operations called CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete). In fact, the user is asked to insert, delete, modify or display information within the frame of a web application. Starting from these facts, we are, in the first place, interested particularly in the display of the objects of a given class while based on information of another object of another class in order that the two classes can be linked together with an arborescence structure where the display of one piece of information depends on another. (For example, the display of the employees of a service that belongs to a division that is part of a department, etc...). This work is extended in order to take into consideration the other CRUD operations. It is part of the attempt led by the models in order to transform a class diagram into an MVC (Model/View/Control) web application with CRUD functions.

663	GameSE_abstract	Implementing Virtual Agents: a HABA-Based Approach	In recent years developments in gaming technology have focused on Massively Multi-User Persistent Worlds. This virtual communities host thousands of users interacting with each other through the Internet in real time. Such communities require new distributed programming paradigms for implementing the virtual life management. In this work we present a practical methodology to add Virtual Agents to Massively Multi-User Persistent Worlds. To demonstrate the use of our methodology we present a realworld application. It adds a set of virtual agents to a 3D chat. The agents survey the users to obtain data to evaluate the processes and components of the virtual world.

664	GameSE_abstract	A General Game Description Language for incomplete information games	A General Game Player is a system that can play previously unknown games given nothing but their rules. The Game Description Language (GDL) has been developed as a high-level knowledge representation formalism for axiomatising the rules of any game, and a basic requirement of a General Game Player is the ability to reason logically about a given game description. In this paper, we address the fundamental limitation of existing GDL to be confined to deterministic games with complete information about the game state. To this end, we develop an extension of GDL that is both simple and elegant yet expressive enough to allow to formalise the rules of arbitrary (discrete and finite) n-player games with randomness and incomplete state knowledge. We also show that this extension suffices to provide players with all information they need to reason about their own knowledge as well as that of the other players up front and during game play.

666	GameSE_abstract	OptiX:a general purpose ray tracing engine	The NVIDIA(r) OptiX(tm) ray tracing engine is a programmable system designed for NVIDIA GPUs and other highly parallel architectures. The OptiX engine builds on the key observation that most ray tracing algorithms can be implemented using a small set of programmable operations. Consequently, the core of OptiX is a domain-specific just-in-time compiler that generates custom ray tracing kernels by combining user-supplied programs for ray generation, material shading, object intersection, and scene traversal. This enables the implementation of a highly diverse set of ray tracing-based algorithms and applications, including interactive rendering, offline rendering, collision detection systems, artificial intelligence queries, and scientific simulations such as sound propagation. OptiX achieves high performance through a compact object model and application of several ray tracing-specific compiler optimizations. For ease of use it exposes a single-ray programming model with full support for recursion and a dynamic dispatch mechanism similar to virtual function calls.	graphics hardware; graphics systems; ray tracing	Steven G.

667	GameSE_abstract	Hack, slash, and chat: a study of players' behavior and communication in MMORPGs	This paper presents an analysis of player behavior in a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG). We examine player behavior in terms of when, how much, and what they do in the virtual world. Player behavior is described through previously defined action categories for MMORPGs (Trading, Questing, Dungeons, Raiding, and Player versus Player (PvP) Combat) with addition of a new category for text and voice communication within a session. We conduct a player survey and perform measurements on the client side for a group of 104 players of a popular MMORPG - World of Warcraft (WoW), and discover that there are significant patterns in player behavior. Additionally we examine the importance of both voice and textual (chat) communication in MMORPGs, and note that communication makes a significant portion of average player's playtime and that voice communication is used by a large portion of players. We believe that the results of this study may be used for improving the existing and design of new MMORPGs (e.g., building better load balancing algorithms, addition of content that is more interesting for players) with more emphasis on both old and new communication aspects of the game (e.g., inbuilt voice clients, new ways of connecting the players). This work also serves as a starting point for better insight into networking requirements for such applications, which may be useful for service and network providers.	session characterization;  MMORPG	Suznjevic, Mirko; Dobrijevic, Ognjen; Matijasevic, Maja	NetGames '09: Proceedings of the 8th Annual Workshop on Network and Systems Support for Games	https://doi.org/10.5555/1837164.1837167	"1.Library for wow AddOns for retrieving server time with higher precision, 2009,  [online]  Available: http://www.wowwiki.com/.

669	GameSE_abstract	Developing a virtual trade fair using an agent-oriented approach	Online virtual trade fairs are becoming a popular way of establishing economic trade relationships nowadays. In the current context of the world economy, new ways of creating virtual environments where suppliers can show their products to potential customers are increasingly in demand. Some people can be found in this kind of scenario representing a role such as, for example, the administrator, the customers or the suppliers. The interaction between them is one of the most important characteristics of these commercial environments. Taking all these concepts into account, this article presents a 3D virtual trade fair that has been defined using an agent-oriented approach. This approach makes it possible to model, understand and implement the virtual economic environment, where interaction is the norm. Moreover, it makes it easy to add new components and meet new requirements in order to develop an open architecture that continuously changes and evolves. In this virtual trade fair, the chosen methodology has been Gaia, widely used for agent-oriented analysis and design of multi-agent systems.

Moreover, it makes it easy to add new components and meet new requirements in order to develop an open architecture that continuously changes and evolves. In this virtual trade fair, the chosen methodology has been Gaia, widely used for agent-oriented analysis and design of multi-agent systems. (c) 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York."",

670	GameSE_abstract	On-the-fly vertex reuse for massively-parallel software geometry processing	Due to its flexibility, compute mode is becoming more and more attractive as a way to implement many of the algorithms part of a state-of-the-art rendering pipeline. A key problem commonly encountered in graphics applications is streaming vertex and geometry processing. In a typical triangle mesh, the same vertex is on average referenced six times. To avoid redundant computation during rendering, a post-transform cache is traditionally employed to reuse vertex processing results. However, such a vertex cache can generally not be implemented efficiently in software and does not scale well as parallelism increases. We explore alternative strategies for reusing per-vertex results on-the-fly during massively-parallel software geometry processing. Given an input stream divided into batches, we analyze the effectiveness of sorting, hashing, and intra-thread-group communication for identifying and exploiting local reuse potential. We design and present four vertex reuse strategies tailored to modern GPU architectures. We demonstrate that, in a variety of applications, these strategies not only achieve effective reuse of vertex processing results, but can boost performance by up to 2-3 compared to a naive approach. Curiously, our experiments also show that our batch-based approaches exhibit behavior similar to the OpenGL implementation on current graphics hardware.

671	GameSE_abstract	Do you trust your software-based traffic generator?	Networking research often relies on synthetic traffic generation in its experimental activities; from generation of realistic workload to active measurements. Often researchers adopt software-based generators because of their flexibility. However, despite the increasing number of features (e.g., replication of complex traffic models), they are still suffering problems that can undermine the correctness of experiments: what is generated is sometimes far from what is requested by the operator. In this article, by analyzing four of the most used packet-level traffic generators in literature, we show how they fail to follow the requested profiles. Moreover, we identify and discuss key concepts affecting their accuracy as well as mechanisms commonly adopted to improve it. This contribution goes toward improving the knowledge researchers and practitioners should have of the tools used in experimental works, and at the same time illustrates some directions for the use and design of software-based traffic generators.

673	GameSE_abstract	Dynamic Fine-Grain Scheduling of Pipeline Parallelism	Scheduling pipeline-parallel programs, defined as a graph of stages that communicate explicitly through queues, is challenging. When the application is regular and the underlying architecture can guarantee predictable execution times, several techniques exist to compute highly optimized static schedules. However, these schedules do not admit run-time load balancing, so variability introduced by the application or the underlying hardware causes load imbalance, hindering performance. On the other hand, existing schemes for dynamic fine-grain load balancing (such as task-stealing) do not work well on pipeline-parallel programs: they cannot guarantee memory footprint bounds, and do not adequately schedule complex graphs or graphs with ordered queues. We present a scheduler implementation for pipeline-parallel programs that performs fine-grain dynamic load balancing efficiently. Specifically, we implement the first real runtime for GRAMPS, a recently proposed programming model that focuses on supporting irregular pipeline and data-parallel applications (in contrast to classical stream programming models and schedulers, which require programs to be regular). Task-stealing with per-stage queues and queuing policies, coupled with a backpressure mechanism, allow us to maintain strict footprint bounds, and a buffer management scheme based on packet-stealing allows low-overhead and locality-aware dynamic allocation of queue data. We evaluate our runtime on a multi-core SMP and find that it provides low-overhead scheduling of irregular workloads while maintaining locality. We also show that the GRAMPS scheduler outperforms several other commonly used scheduling approaches. Specifically, while a typical task-stealing scheduler performs on par with GRAMPS on simple graphs, it does significantly worse on complex ones, a canonical GPGPU scheduler cannot exploit pipeline parallelism and suffers from large memory footprints, and a typical static, streaming scheduler achieves somewhat...

675	GameSE_abstract	A Panorama of Artificial and Computational Intelligence in Games	This paper attempts to give a high-level overview of the field of artificial and computational intelligence (AI/CI) in games, with particular reference to how the different core research areas within this field inform and interact with each other, both actually and potentially. We identify ten main research areas within this field: NPC behavior learning, search and planning, player modeling, games as AI benchmarks, procedural content generation, computational narrative, believable agents, AI-assisted game design, general game artificial intelligence and AI in commercial games. We view and analyze the areas from three key perspectives: 1) the dominant AI method(s) used under each area; 2) the relation of each area with respect to the end (human) user; and 3) the placement of each area within a human-computer (player-game) interaction perspective. In addition, for each of these areas we consider how it could inform or interact with each of the other areas; in those cases where we find that meaningful interaction either exists or is possible, we describe the character of that interaction and provide references to published studies, if any. We believe that this paper improves understanding of the current nature of the game AI/CI research field and the interdependences between its core areas by providing a unifying overview. We also believe that the discussion of potential interactions between research areas provides a pointer to many interesting future research projects and unexplored subfields.

676	GameSE_abstract	Automatic prototyping in model-driven game development	Model-driven game development (MDGD) is an emerging paradigm where models become first-order elements in game development, maintenance, and evolution. In this article, we present a first approach to 2D platform game prototyping automatization through the use of model-driven engineering (MDE). Platform-independent models (PIM) define the structure and the behavior of the games and a platform-specific model (PSM) describes the game control mapping. Automatic MOFscript transformations from these models generate the software prototype code in C++. As an example, Bubble Bobble has been prototyped in a few hours following the MDGD approach. The resulting code generation represents 93% of the game prototype.

Automatic MOFscript transformations from these models generate the software prototype code in C++. As an example, Bubble Bobble has been prototyped in a few hours following the MDGD approach.

677	GameSE_abstract	Evolutionary Competition in Platform Ecosystems	Intraplatform competition has received scant attention in prior studies, which predominantly study interplatform competition. We develop a middle-range theory ofhowcomplementarity between input control and a platform extension's modularization-by inducing evolution-influences its performance in a platform market. Primary and archival data spanning five years from 342 Firefox extensions show that such complementarity fosters performance by accelerating an extension's perpetual evolution.

678	GameSE_abstract	Value creation in innovation ecosystems: How the structure of technological interdependence affects firm performance in new technology generations	The success of an innovating firm often depends on the efforts of other innovators in its environment. How do the challenges faced by external innovators affect the focal firm's outcomes? To address this question we first characterize the external environment according to the structure of interdependence. We follow the flow of inputs and outputs in the ecosystem to distinguish between upstream components that are bundled by the focal firm, and downstream complements that are bundled by the firm's customers. We hypothesize that the effects of external innovation challenges depend not only on their magnitude, but also on their location in the ecosystem relative to the focal firm. We identify a key asymmetry that results from the location of challenges relative to a focal firm-greater upstream innovation challenges in components enhance the benefits that accrue to technology leaders, while greater downstream innovation challenges in complements erode these benefits. We further propose that the effectiveness of vertical integration as a strategy to manage ecosystem interdependence increases over the course of the technology life cycle. We explore these arguments in the context of the global semiconductor lithography equipment industry from its emergence in 1962 to 2005 across nine distinct technology generations. We find strong empirical support for our framework.

679	GameSE_abstract	An automated framework for software test oracle	Context: One of the important issues of software testing is to provide an automated test oracle. Test oracles are reliable sources of how the software under test must operate. In particular, they are used to evaluate the actual results that produced by the software. However, in order to generate an automated test oracle, oracle challenges need to be addressed. These challenges are output-domain generation, input domain to output domain mapping, and a comparator to decide on the accuracy of the actual outputs.Objective: This paper proposes an automated test oracle framework to address all of these challenges.Method: I/O Relationship Analysis is used to generate the output domain automatically and Multi-Networks Oracles based on artificial neural networks are introduced to handle the second challenge. The last challenge is addressed using an automated comparator that adjusts the oracle precision by defining the comparison tolerance. The proposed approach was evaluated using an industry strength case study, which was injected with some faults. The quality of the proposed oracle was measured by assessing its accuracy, precision, misclassification error and practicality. Mutation testing was considered to provide the evaluation framework by implementing two different versions of the case study: a Golden Version and a Mutated Version. Furthermore, a comparative study between the existing automated oracles and the proposed one is provided based on which challenges they can automate.Results: Results indicate that the proposed approach automated the oracle generation process 97% in this experiment. Accuracy of the proposed oracle was up to 98.26%, and the oracle detected up to 97.7% of the injected faults.Conclusion: Consequently, the results of the study highlight the practicality of the proposed oracle in addition to the automation it offers.

In particular, we focus on analyzing behavior patterns in the popular team-based first-person perspective game Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. This game belongs to a genre characterized by two moderate-sized teams (usually 6 to 12 players each) competing over a set of objectives. Our system allows spectators to visualize global features such as large-scale behaviors and team strategies, as opposed to the limited, local view that traditional spectating modes provide. We also add overlay visualizations of semantic information related to the action that might be important to a spectator in order to reduce the information overload that plagues traditional overview visualizations. These overlays can visualize information about abstract concepts such as player distribution over time and areas of intense combat activity, and also highlight important features like player paths, fire coverage, etc. This added information allows spectators to identify important game events more easily and reveals large-scale player behaviors that might otherwise be overlooked.

681	GameSE_abstract	Extending test templates with inheritance	We are extending a framework for specification-based testing, the Test Template Framework, to include object-oriented features such as those provided in Object-Z. We report on our work extending the framework to include inheritance. In testing a subclass, the testing information for the parent class is inherited and thus reused. We have identified conditions under which testing information can be inherited without change, when it is inherited with modifications and when it must be derived from scratch. We illustrate the technique with an example based on the Eiffel Queue classes.

682	GameSE_abstract	Practical Combinatorial Testing: Beyond Pairwise	With new algorithms and tools, developers can apply high-strength combinatorial testing to detect elusive failures that occur only when multiple components interact. In pairwise testing, all possible pairs of parameter values are covered by at least one test, and good tools are available to generate arrays with the value pairs. In the past few years, advances in covering-array algorithms, integrated with model checking or other testing approaches, have made it practical to extend combinatorial testing beyond pairwise tests. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the University of Texas, Arlington, are now distributing freely available methods and tools for constructing large t-way combination test sets (known as covering arrays), converting covering arrays into executable tests, and automatically generating test oracles using model checking (http://csrc.nist.gov/acts). In this review, we focus on real-world problems and empirical results from applying these methods and tools.

683	GameSE_abstract	Why Good Developers Write Bad Code: An Observational Case Study of the Impacts of Organizational Factors on Software Quality	How can organizational factors such as structure and culture have an impact on the working conditions of developers? This study is based on ten months of observation of an in-house software development project within a large telecommunications company. The observation was conducted during mandatory weekly status meetings, where technical and managerial issues were raised and discussed. Preliminary results show that many decisions made under the pressure of certain organizational factors negatively affected software quality. This paper describes cases depicting the complexity of organizational factors and reports on ten issues that have had a negative impact on quality, followed by suggested avenues for corrective action.

684	GameSE_abstract	A Model Predictive Control Framework for Hybrid Dynamical Systems	This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that asymptotically stabilizes a compact set of interest for a given hybrid dynamical system. The considered class of systems are described by a general model, which identifies the dynamics by the combination of constrained differential and difference equations. The model allows for trajectories that exhibit multiple jumps at the same time instant, or portray Zeno behavior. At every optimization time, the proposed algorithm minimizes a cost functional weighting the state and the input during both the continuous and discrete phases, and at the terminal time via a terminal cost, without discretizing the continuous dynamics. To account for the structure of time domains defining solution pairs, the minimization is performed in a manner akin to free end-time optimal control. When the terminal cost is a control Lyapunov function on the terminal constraint set, recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability of the proposed algorithm can be guaranteed. A sample-and-hold control system and a bouncing ball model are two examples reported to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.	hybrid systems; predictive control; optimal control; asymptotic stability; nonlinear control systems	Altin, Berk; Ojaghi, Pegah; Sanfelice, Ricardo G.

685	GameSE_abstract	Evaluating complexity, code churn, and developer activity metrics as indicators of software vulnerabilities	Security inspection and testing require experts in security who think like an attacker. Security experts need to know code locations on which to focus their testing and inspection efforts. Since vulnerabilities are rare occurrences, locating vulnerable code locations can be a challenging task. We investigated whether software metrics obtained from source code and development history are discriminative and predictive of vulnerable code locations. If so, security experts can use this prediction to prioritize security inspection and testing efforts. The metrics we investigated fall into three categories: complexity, code churn, and developer activity metrics. We performed two empirical case studies on large, widely used open-source projects: the Mozilla Firefox web browser and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel. The results indicate that 24 of the 28 metrics collected are discriminative of vulnerabilities for both projects. The models using all three types of metrics together predicted over 80 percent of the known vulnerable files with less than 25 percent false positives for both projects. Compared to a random selection of files for inspection and testing, these models would have reduced the number of files and the number of lines of code to inspect or test by over 71 and 28 percent, respectively, for both projects.

Security experts need to know code locations on which to focus their testing and inspection efforts. Since vulnerabilities are rare occurrences, locating vulnerable code locations can be a challenging task. We investigated whether software metrics obtained from source code and development history are discriminative and predictive of vulnerable code locations. If so, security experts can use this prediction to prioritize security inspection and testing efforts. The metrics we investigated fall into three categories: complexity, code churn, and developer activity metrics. We performed two empirical case studies on large, widely used open-source projects: the Mozilla Firefox web browser and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel. The results indicate that 24 of the 28 metrics collected are discriminative of vulnerabilities for both projects. The models using all three types of metrics together predicted over 80 percent of the known vulnerable files with less than 25 percent false positives for both projects. Compared to a random selection of files for inspection and testing, these models would have reduced the number of files and the number of lines of code to inspect or test by over 71 and 28 percent, respectively, for both projects.

686	GameSE_abstract	Industry life-cycle theory in the cultural domain: Dynamics of the games industry	"Industry life-cycle theory is interested in changes in key industry variables, including entry and exit rates, firm numbers, price, performance and concentration, and in innovative activity as the industry ages. To date, industry life-cycle studies have concentrated on traditional manufacturing industries that produce utilitarian goods. The present study investigates the dynamics of the games industry which is a prime example of a non-manufacturing and non-utilitarian industry. As prior research on the games industry is scarce, the cultural industries literature is reviewed to shed light on the conformities and deviations that can be expected to be found between the propositions of the industry life-cycle theory and the empirical analysis on the games industry. The specificities of cultural industries are discussed in terms of economic characteristics, management challenges and industry dynamics.
The empirical study comprises two analytical steps. The first one investigates the evolution of the games industry with standard industry life-cycle tools. In the second one a qualitative systems dynamics model on the micromechanisms of the game development sector is built to explain the observations made in the first step.
The key finding of the study is that the dynamics of the games industry differ from the propositions of the industry life-cycle theory in two respects. Firstly, innovative activity has not levelled off in either hardware or software. Secondly, game development has remained an unconcentrated industry. The innovative activity is explained by the constant need for novelty common to all cultural industries and it manifests in the key role that the production of original ideas has in game development firms. The low level of concentration is explained by lesser economies of scale caused by increasing management challenges and the increasing risk of bankruptcy with increase in firm size.
The study contributes (1) by applying the industry life-cycle theory to the cultural domain, (2) by combining the phenomena listed in the cultural industries literature and analysing their effect on industry dynamics, (3) by examining the evolution of the games industry in both hardware and software sectors and (4) by highlighting the micromechanisms that produce industry dynamics. The study also has implications for policy-making and management practice. These relate to different forms of public funding, education, outsourcing and the key role of original IP."

687	GameSE_abstract	There is No Magic Circle	Games are created through the act of gameplay, which is contingent on player acts. However, to understand gameplay, we must also investigate contexts, justifications, and limitations. Cheating can be an excellent path into studying the gameplay situation, because it lays bare player's frustrations and limitations. It points to ludic hopes and activities, and it causes us to question our values, our ethics. In comparison, the concept of the magic circle seems static and overly formalist. Structures may be necessary to begin gameplay, but we cannot stop at structures as a way of understanding the gameplay experience. Because of that, we cannot say that games are magic circles, where the ordinary rules of life do not apply. Of course they apply, but in addition to, in competition with, other rules and in relation to multiple contexts, across varying cultures, and into different groups, legal situations, and homes.	magic circle; video games; game studies; game theory; real-money trade	Consalvo, Mia	GAMES AND CULTURE	https://doi.org/10.1177/1555412009343575		408-417			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2009	There is No Magic Circle	https://doi.org/10.1177/1555412009343575	SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
688	GameSE_abstract	Using open innovation to identify the best ideas	As innovation becomes more democratic, many of the best ideas for new products and services no longer originate in well-financed corporate and government laboratories. How can companies tap into distributed knowledge and diverse skills? Increasingly, organizations are considering using an open-innovation process, but many are finding that making open innovation work can be more complicated than it looks. The authors research suggests that executives in numerous industries face the same fundamental decisions when exploring open innovation: (1) whether to open the idea-generation process, (2) whether to open the idea-selection process or (3) whether to open both. The key to success, the authors argue, is careful consideration of what to open, how to open it and how to manage the new problems created by the openness. Although the authors found that many managers were fearful about venturing into an entirely new type of innovation process, they maintain that open innovation is rooted in classic innovation principles such as idea generation and selection. The first benefit of open innovation is the number of ideas that become available. Statistically, the more ideas generated, the better the quality of the best one is likely to be. A second, lesser-known advantage of open innovation is that the value of the best idea generally increases with the variability of the ideas received. There are advantages to casting the net widely enough to access ideas of diverse quality: The quality of the average idea may fall, but the best idea is more likely to be spectacular. While managers are often apprehensive about idea creation through open innovation, many are completely unfamiliar with the possibilities offered by opening idea selection. They assume that only company employees can make good choices about which ideas are best. Yet the authors found that outsiders provide distinctive expertise and perspectives, which enable companies to pick winning ideas and generate significant value. This is particularly true with products that can be used in many ways, or when fashions or requirements change quickly. A potential problem in open innovation, the authors point out, relates to how companies contract with idea generators. A second challenge in managing open innovation is caused by a shift in who bears the cost (and risk) of idea generation. With open innovation, the company pays for a design only after it has been completed. This means that the idea generator bears both the cost and the risk of developing a design. Opening up the selection process has its own perils. Managers need to consider whether outsiders have unique knowledge about customer needs. If managers conclude that an outside perspective is useful in the selection process, they should ask themselves whether they can align the incentives of the outside selectors with the company's goals. When both idea development and selection are done by outsiders, the authors say, a new business model is usually needed to capture value.		King, Andrew; Lakhani, Karim R.

689	GameSE_abstract	5th FME Workshop on Formal Methods in Software Engineering (FormaliSE 2017)	Summary form only given. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. FormaliSE 2017 Workshop Summary. FormaliSE is a yearly workshop on Formal Methods in Software Engineering. FormaliSE is organized by FME (Formal Methods Europe) and is co-located with ICSE (International Conference on Software Engineering). The main goal of the workshop is to foster integration between the formal methods and the software engineering communities. The lack of formalization in key places makes software engineering overly sensitive to the weaknesses that are inevitable in the complex activities behind software creation. This is where formal methods (FMs) have a huge opportunity. The PROGRAM features invited talks and presentations of submitted papers. The workshop also includes a panel discussion, addressing the subjects that came up during the workshop.

690	GameSE_abstract	Unpaid crowd complementors: The platform network effect mirage	Platforms have evolved beyond just being organized as multi-sided markets with complementors selling to users. Complementors are often unpaid, working outside of a price system and driven by heterogeneous sources of motivation - which should affect how they respond to platform growth. Does reliance on network effects and strategies to attract large numbers of complementors remain advisable in such contexts? We test hypotheses related to these issues using data from 85 online multi-player game platforms with unpaid complementors. We find that complementor development responds to platform growth even without sales incentives, but that attracting complementors has a net zero effect on on-going development and fails to stimulate network effects. We discuss conditions under which a strategy of using unpaid crowd complementors remains advantageous.

691	GameSE_abstract	3-D-Printed Dielectric Slab Rectangular Waveguide for TE_{10}and TE_{20}Mode Equalization	The dielectric slab rectangular waveguide (DSRW) has been widely studied and used for increasing the single-mode bandwidth (BW) of rectangular waveguides. This work presents a DSRW for equalizing the group velocity of the first two propagating modes in the structure. Suitably scaled, this DSRW design can be used in chip-to-chip communications to yield interconnects that avoid dispersion while enhancing the BW density of these systems. A theoretical analysis is introduced to show the equalization BW attained depending on the slab dimensions with regard to the rectangular waveguide width and the dielectric permittivity of the materials that fill the waveguide. A proof of concept slab rectangular waveguide is designed to meet a 45% equalization BW around a center frequency of 10.0 GHz. The design is scalable and can be adapted to fit the dielectric permittivity of available materials. Several waveguide sections were fabricated using additive manufacturing (AM) techniques and two dielectric materials with different permittivities. Simulations and measurements confirm the waveguide behavior at the design frequency range. TE_{10}and TE_{20}modes exhibit the same group velocity of 0.36\timesc_{0}at 7.95 GHz.

693	GameSE_abstract	What Concerns Game Developers? A Study on Game Development Processes, Sustainability and Metrics	It can be argued, that software development and game development share a number of features in their process models, such as the need to design, develop and test software functionalities. However, while the software engineering (SE) models work successfully supporting the software development, their practical application for game development is frequently unsuccessful. To understand this problem and number of other aspects such as Green IT and business models, we conducted a survey with the game industry organizations. Based on our observations on the SE practices, the game industry applies mostly the agile process models or nothing at all, their major concerns for business were mobile development, digital marketing, employees with specific abilities and keeping innovation in their business, and their minor concerns were eco-impact elements, software reusability and financing. Based on our results, we identified areas which would warrant more studies to support the game industry practices, eco-aspects and business.	software engineering; games as software; process models; marketing; game business; sustainability; quantitative study	Kasurinen, Jussi; Palacin-Silva, Maria; Vanhala, Erno	2017 IEEE/ACM 8TH WORKSHOP ON EMERGING TRENDS IN SOFTWARE METRICS (WETSOM)	https://doi.org/10.1109/WETSoM.2017.3		15-21			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2017	WETSoM@ICSE - What concerns game developers?: a study on game development processes, sustainability and metrics	https://doi.org/10.1109/WETSoM.2017.3	IEEE	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
694	GameSE_abstract	Multihoming in two-sided markets: An empirical inquiry in the video game console industry	Two-sided markets are composed of platform owners and two distinct user networks that either buy or sell applications for the platform. The authors focus on multihoming-the choice of an agent in a user network to use more than one platform. In the context of the video game console industry, they examine the conditions affecting seller-level multihoming decisions on a given platform. Furthermore, they investigate how platform-level multihoming of applications affects the sales of the platform. The authors show that increased platform-level multihoming of applications hurts platform sales, a finding consistent with literature on brand differentiation, but they also show that this effect vanishes as platforms mature or gain market share. The authors find that platform-level multihoming of applications affects platform sales more strongly than the number of applications. Furthermore, among mature platforms, an increasing market share leads to more seller-level multihoming, while among nascent platforms, seller-level multihoming decreases as platform market share increases. These findings prompt scholars to look beyond network size in analyzing two-sided markets and provide guidance to both (application) sellers and platform owners.

695	GameSE_abstract	Control de balance y de fase con ePLL en convertidores buck con interleaving	En este trabajo se propone una estrategia para el control de la diferencia de fase y el balance de las corrientes de rama en convertidores buck con interleaving y control por modos deslizantes. La propuesta consiste en la determinacion de la fase de la componente fundamental de la funcion de deslizamiento mediante lazos de enganche de fase ePLL (enhanced Phased-Locked Loop) y el control de la amplitud de la region de deslizamiento. El balance de valor medio de las corrientes de rama se implementa mediante un control asimetrico de la amplitud de la region deslizamiento. La estrategia admite la reconfiguracion del numero de ramas, la secuencia y la diferencia de fase con el proposito de lograr tolerancia a fallas, incrementar la eficiencia y reducir el ripple de tension a bornes de la carga. La propuesta se verifica mediante simulacion para un convertidor buck de tres ramas y topologia maestro-esclavo.

696	GameSE_abstract	A novel approach for estimating Truck Factors	Truck Factor (TF) is a metric proposed by the agile community as a tool to identify concentration of knowledge in software development environments. It states the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a truck (or quit) before a project is incapacitated. In other words, TF helps to measure how prepared is a project to deal with developer turnover. Despite its clear relevance, few studies explore this metric. Altogether there is no consensus about how to calculate it, and no supporting evidence backing estimates for systems in the wild. To mitigate both issues, we propose a novel (and automated) approach for estimating TF-values, which we execute against a corpus of 133 popular project in GitHub. We later survey developers as a means to assess the reliability of our results. Among others, we find that the majority of our target systems (65%) have TF <= 2. Surveying developers from 67 target systems provides confidence towards our estimates; in 84% of the valid answers we collect, developers agree or partially agree that the TF's authors are the main authors of their systems; in 53% we receive a positive or partially positive answer regarding our estimated truck factors.

697	GameSE_abstract	Optimal kinodynamic motion planning using incremental sampling-based methods	Sampling-based algorithms such as the Rapidlyexploring Random Tree (RRT) have been recently proposed as an effective approach to computationally hard motion planning problem. However, while the RRT algorithm is known to be able to find a feasible solution quickly, there are no guarantees on the quality of such solution, e.g., with respect to a given cost functional. To address this limitation, the authors recently proposed a new algorithm, called RRT*, which ensures asymptotic optimality, i.e., almost sure convergence of the solution returned by the algorithm to an optimal solution, while maintaining the same properties of the standard RRT algorithm, both in terms of computation of feasible solutions, and of computational complexity. In this paper, the RRT* algorithm is extended to deal with differential constraints. A sufficient condition for asymptotic optimality is provided. It is shown that the RRT* algorithm equipped with any local steering procedure that satisfies this condition converges to an optimal solution almost surely. In particular, simple local steering procedures are provided for a Dubins' vehicle as well as a double integrator. Simulation examples are also provided for these systems comparing the RRT and the RRT* algorithms.

Our system not only shows site topology and traffic flow, but by segmenting site traffic data based on user attributes, including demographic data and purchase history, we can present a more complete picture of web site usage. This can lead to a more focussed analysis that allows direct comparison between user segments, and ultimately a deeper understanding of how users interact with a site. The tool is designed for real world use, and we present a usage study of the tool by analyzing the data of a failed dot-com""."""

702	GameSE_abstract	Doors and Perception: Fiction vs. Simulation in Games	In this paper, the author outlines a theory of the relationship of fictional, virtual and real elements in games. Not much critical attention has been paid to the concept of fiction when applied to games and game worlds, despite many books, articles and papers using the term, often in the title. Here, it is argued that game worlds and their objects are ontologically different from fictional worlds; they are empirically upheld by the game engine, rather than by our mind stimulated by verbal information. Game phenomena such as labyrinths, moreover, are evidence that games contain elements that are just as real as their equivalents outside the game, and far from equal to the fictional counterparts.	nan	Aarseth, Espen	Intermediality	https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/im/2007-n9-im1814828/1005528ar/abstract/	nan	nan	nan		Excluded	snowballing			2	GoogleScholar	2011	Doors and Perception: Fiction vs. Simulation in Games	https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/im/2007-n9-im1814828/1005528ar/abstract/	i? 1/2rudit

Diegetic and non-diegetic sounds in computer games revisited	This chapter is a critical discussion of the use of the concepts diegetic and non-diegetic in connection with computer game sound. These terms are problematic because they do not take into account the functional aspects of sound and indicate how gameworlds differ from traditional fictional worlds.

705	GameSE_abstract	Hybrid dynamical systems logic and its refinements	Hybrid dynamical systems describe the mixed discrete dynamics and continuous dynamics of cyber-physical systems such as aircraft, cars, trains, and robots. To justify correctness properties of the safety-critical control algorithms for their physical models, differential dynamic logic ([Formula presented]) provides deductive specification and verification techniques implemented in the theorem prover [Formula presented]. The logic [Formula presented] is useful for proving, e.g., that all runs of a hybrid dynamical system a satisfy safety property ph (i.e., [Formula presented]), or that there is a run of the hybrid dynamical system a ultimately reaching the desired goal ph (i.e., [Formula presented]). Logical combinations of [Formula presented]'s operators naturally represent safety, liveness, stability and other properties. Variations of [Formula presented] serve additional purposes. Differential refinement logic ([Formula presented]) adds an operator a<=b expressing that hybrid system a refines hybrid system b, which is useful, e.g., for relating concrete system implementations a to their abstract verification models b. Just like [Formula presented], [Formula presented] is a logic closed under all operators, which opens up systematic ways of simultaneously relating systems and their properties, of reducing system properties to system relations or, vice versa, reducing system relations to system properties. A second variant of [Formula presented], differential game logic ([Formula presented]), adds the ability of referring to winning strategies of players in hybrid games, which is useful for establishing correctness properties where the actions of different agents may interfere either because they literally compete with one another or because they may interact accidentally. In the theorem prover [Formula presented], [Formula presented] and its variations have been used for verifying ground robot obstacle avoidance, the Federal Aviation Administration's Next-Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance System ACAS X, and the Federal Railroad Administration's train control model.

707	GameSE_abstract	A critical analysis of the research methodologies reported in the full papers of the proceedings of ICALT 2004	Five reviewers conducted a methodological review of the full papers in the proceedings of ICALT 2004. They analyzed the papers in terms of research design, common defects, section proportions, measures used, and region of the first author's affiliation. It was found that the majority of articles were methodological/theoretical articles or program descriptions that did not report research on human participants. Of the articles that involved human participants - posttest-only designs without controls were the most common, many articles lacked appropriate interpretations and needed controls, the majority of space was devoted to program description, and student surveys were the most common type of measurement. Recommendations for ICALT authors and reviewers are given.	Educational technology	J. Randolph; R. Bednarik; P. Silander; J. Gonzalez; N. Myller; E.

708	GameSE_abstract	Adaptive Interaction Fault Location Based on Combinatorial Testing	Combinatorial testing aims to detect interaction faults, which are triggered by interaction among parameters in system, by covering some specific combinations of parametric values. Most works about combinatorial testing focus on detecting such interaction faults rather than locating them. Based on the model of interaction fault schema, in which the interaction fault is described as a minimum fault schema and several corresponding parent-schemas, we propose an iterative adaptive interaction fault location technique for combinatorial testing. In order to locate interaction faults that detected in combinatorial testing, such technique utilizes delta debugging strategy to filtrate suspicious schemas by generating and running additional test cases iteratively. The properties, which include both recall and precision, of adaptive interaction fault location techniques are also analyzed in this paper. Analytical results suggest that the high scores in both recall and precision are guaranteed. It means that such technique can provide an efficient guidance for the applications of combinatorial testing.

709	GameSE_abstract	A formal support for incremental behavior specification in agile development	Incremental development is now state of the practice. Indeed, it is promoted from the rational unified process to agile development methods. Few methods however guide software developers and architects in doing so. For instance, no tool is proposed to verify the non-regression of functionalities, modeled as behavior specifications, between increments. This work helps to incrementally specify software functionalities using UML state machines. It provides an on-the-fly evaluation of a specified behavior as compared to that of previous increments. The proposed contribution is based on two formally specified relations that are proved to preserve refinement when composed. Architects and developers are free to choose their preferred behavior specification strategy by iteratively applying them, so as to develop the required functionalities, having at each step the benefit of a formal non-regression checking to guide the global specification process. Our proposal is implemented in a proof-of-concept tool and illustrated by a didactic casestudy.

In the following, we will see examples of four genres that situate the player in different positions with respect to the gameworld. Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars illustrates a game where the player does not have a playable figure in the gameworld, while Crysis exemplifies a game where player and playable figure viewpoints merge into one entity. Diablo 2 represents a game with a developing figure, and The Sims 2 demonstrates a hybrid combination of named, developing figures controlled by the player from a god perspective. The study shows that players tend to accept all features that aid them in understanding how to play the game, and that it does not matter whether features have a stylistic or naturalistic relationship to the gameworld. Regarding the relationship between player and playable figure, the respondents do not see the dual position of the player situated in the physical world while having the power to act within the gameworld as a paradox, but a necessary way of communication in games.

711	GameSE_abstract	What's in a GitHub Star? Understanding Repository Starring Practices in a Social Coding Platform	Besides a git-based version control system, GitHub integrates several social coding features. Particularly, GitHub users can star a repository, presumably to manifest interest or satisfaction with an open source project. However, the real and practical meaning of starring a project was never the subject of an in-depth and well-founded empirical investigation. Therefore, we provide in this paper a throughout study on the meaning, characteristics, and dynamic growth of GitHub stars. First, by surveying 791 developers, we report that three out of four developers consider the number of stars before using or contributing to a GitHub project. Then, we report a quantitative analysis on the characteristics of the top-5,000 most starred GitHub repositories. We propose four patterns to describe stars growth, which are derived after clustering the time series representing the number of stars of the studied repositories: we also reveal the perception of 115 developers about these growth patterns. To conclude, we provide a list of recommendations to open source project managers (e.g., on the importance of social media promotion) and to GitHub users and Software Engineering researchers (e.g., on the risks faced when selecting projects by GitHub stars).

712	GameSE_abstract	Platform Performance Investment in the Presence of Network Externalities	"Managers of emerging platforms must decide what level of platform performance to invest in at each product development cycle in markets that exhibit two-sided network externalities. High performance is a selling point for consumers, but in many cases it requires developers to make large investments to participate. Abstracting from an example drawn from the video game industry, we build a strategic model to investigate the trade-off between investing in high platform performance versus reducing investment in order to facilitate third party content development. We carry out a full analysis of three distinct settings: monopoly, price-setting duopoly, and price-taking duopoly. We provide insights on the optimum investment in platform performance and demonstrate how conventional wisdom about product development may be misleading in the presence of strong cross-network externalities. In particular, we show that, contrary to the conventional wisdom about ""winner-take-all"" markets, heavily investing in the core performance of a platform does not always yield a competitive edge. We characterize the conditions under which offering a platform with lower performance but greater availability of content can be a winning strategy."	two-sided markets; network externality; product development; video game industry	Anderson, Edward G., Jr.; Parker, Geoffrey G.; Tan, Burcu	INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH	https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2013.0505		152-172			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2014	Platform Performance Investment in the Presence of Network Externalities	https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2013.0505	INFORMS	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
713	GameSE_abstract	Dissecting games engines: The case of Unity3D	Recent trends on how video games are played have pushed for the need to revise the game engine architecture. Indeed, game players are more mobile, using smartphones and tablets that lack CPU resources compared to PC and dedicated box. Two emerging solutions, cloud gaming and computing offload, would represent the next steps toward improving game player experience. By consequence, dissecting and analyzing game engines performances would help to better understand how to move to these new directions, which is so far missing in the literature. In this paper, we fill this gap by analyzing and evaluating one of the most popular game engine, namely Unity3D. First, we dissected the Unity3D architecture and modules. A benchmark was then used to evaluate the CPU and GPU performances of the different modules constituting Unity3D, for five representative games.

A number of contributions have been made so far to map Object-Z to various object-oriented languages. However, the given mapping approaches do not cover several Object-Z specification constructs, such as class union, object aggregation, object containment and some of the operation operators. Also, in much of the existing work, mapping rules are given in a very abstract form. In other words, they do not consider all cases in a detailed way needed to automate the mapping procedure. In our previous work, we partially tackled these issues; however, in this paper, we present a much more comprehensive way to animate Object-Z specifications using C++.

715	GameSE_abstract	NETWORKS, PLATFORMS, AND STRATEGY: EMERGING VIEWS AND NEXT STEPS	"Research summary: A substantial and burgeoning body of research has described the influence of platform-mediated networks in a wide variety of settings, whereby users and complementors desire compatibility on a common platform. In this review, we outline extant views of these dynamics from the industrial organization (IO) economics, technology management, and strategic management perspectives. Using this review as a foundation, we propose a future research agenda in this domain that focuses the on the relative influence of network effects and platform quality in competitive outcomes, drivers of indirect network effects, the nature and attributes of complementors, and leveraging complementor dynamics for competitive advantage. Managerial summary: In many industries, such as social networks and video games, consumers place greater value on products with a large network of other users and a large variety of complementary products. Such "" network effects"" offer lucrative opportunities for firms that can leverage these dynamics to create dominant technology platforms. This article reviews current perspectives on network effects and the emergence of platforms, and offers several areas of future consideration for optimal strategies in these settings."	platforms; network effects; complements; technology standards; ecosystems	Mcintyre, David P.; Srinivasan, Arati	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.2596		141-160			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2016	Networks, platforms, and strategy: Emerging views and next steps	https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.2596	WILEY	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
716	GameSE_abstract	The role of complementary products on platform adoption: Evidence from the video console market	This paper studies the importance of the interdependences within platform-based markets. Specifically, the work examines the influence of complementary product portfolios on the adoption of platforms by individuals. The study analyzes data from a panel of 17 video game platforms in three regions (the US, Japan and Europe) for the period between 1989 and 2011. The results suggest that platform adoption is driven by the availability and users of complementary products. The study also finds that this impact is stronger when platform providers jointly manage the in-house complementary product portfolio and the platform. These findings reveal that decisions on complementary products act as strategic drivers of adoption in platform-based markets.

Specifically, the work examines the influence of complementary product portfolios on the adoption of platforms by individuals. The study analyzes data from a panel of 17 video game platforms in three regions (the US, Japan and Europe) for the period between 1989 and 2011. The results suggest that platform adoption is driven by the availability and users of complementary products. The study also finds that this impact is stronger when platform providers jointly manage the in-house complementary product portfolio and the platform. These findings reveal that decisions on complementary products act as strategic drivers of adoption in platform-based markets. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd."",

718	GameSE_abstract	The promises and perils of mining GitHub	With over 10 million git repositories, GitHub is becoming one of the most important source of software artifacts on the Internet. Researchers are starting to mine the information stored in GitHub's event logs, trying to understand how its users employ the site to collaborate on software. However, so far there have been no studies describing the quality and properties of the data available from GitHub. We document the results of an empirical study aimed at understanding the characteristics of the repositories in GitHub and how users take advantage of GitHub's main features---namely commits, pull requests, and issues. Our results indicate that, while GitHub is a rich source of data on software development, mining GitHub for research purposes should take various potential perils into consideration. We show, for example, that the majority of the projects are personal and inactive; that GitHub is also being used for free storage and as a Web hosting service; and that almost 40\% of all pull requests do not appear as merged, even though they were. We provide a set of recommendations for software engineering researchers on how to approach the data in GitHub.	github;  git;  code reviews;  bias;  Mining software repositories	Kalliamvakou, Eirini; Gousios, Georgios; Blincoe, Kelly; Singer, Leif; German, Daniel M.; Damian, Daniela	MSR 2014: Proceedings of the 11th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories	https://doi.org/10.1145/2597073.2597074		92-101	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2597073.2597074,

719	GameSE_abstract	Platform architecture and quality trade-offs of multihoming complements	Multihoming, the decision to design a complement to operate on multiple platforms, is becoming increasingly common in many platform markets. Perceived wisdom suggests that multihoming is beneficial for complement providers as they expand their market reach, but it reduces differentiation among competing platforms as the same complements become available on different platforms. We argue that complement providers face trade-offs when designing their products for multiple platform architectures-they must decide how far to specialize the complement to each platform's technological specifications. Because of these trade-offs, multihoming complements can have different quality performance across platforms. In a study of the U.S. video game industry, we find that multihoming games have lower-quality performance on a technologically more complex console than on a less complex one. Also, games designed for and released on a focal platform have lower-quality performance on platforms they are subsequently multihomed to. However, games that are released on the complex platform with a delay suffer a smaller drop in quality on complex platforms. This has important implications for platform competition, and for managers considering expanding their reach through multihoming.

720	GameSE_abstract	Translating Object-Z specifications to passive test oracles	A test oracle provides a means for determining whether an implementation functions according to its specification. A passive test oracle checks the behaviour of the implementation, but does not attempt to reproduce this behaviour. The paper describes the translation of formal specifications of container classes to passive test oracles. Specifically, we use Object-Z for specifications and C++ for oracles. We discuss several practical issues for the use of formal specifications in test oracle generation. We then present the translation process and illustrate it with an example based on an integer set class. Our approach is illustrated with an example based on an integer set class.

Platform leaders such as Apple or IBM need to consider many technological, strategic, and network factors in managing their industry platforms. We explore how platform leaders deploy these factors and their interactions during a battle for market dominance. We find that platform leaders choose various control modes to do so, ranging from central control to distributed control. The adoption of these control modes is dependent on the choice of being first entrant with a technological discontinuity (central control) or follower (distributed control).

722	GameSE_abstract	ENTRY INTO PLATFORM-BASED MARKETS	This paper examines the relative importance of platform quality, indirect network effects, and consumer expectations on the success of entrants in platform-based markets. We develop a theoretical model and find that an entrant's success depends on the strength of indirect network effects and on the consumers' discount factor for future applications. We then illustrate the model's applicability by examining Xbox's entry into the video game industry. We find that Xbox had a small quality advantage over the incumbent, PlayStation 2, and the strength of indirect network effects and the consumers' discount factor, while statistically significant, fall in the region where PlayStation 2's position is unsustainable.	platform-based markets; winner-take-all; first-mover advantage; indirect network effects; video game industry	Zhu, Feng; Iansiti, Marco	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.941		88-106			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2011	Entry into Platform-based Markets	https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.941	WILEY	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
723	GameSE_abstract	Exploring game space of minimal action games via parameter tuning and survival analysis	Game designers can use computer-aided game design methods to model how players may experience the perceived difficulty of a game. We present methods to generate and analyze the difficulty of a wide variety of minimal action game variants throughout game space, where each point in this abstract design space represents a unique game variant. Focusing on a parameterized version of Flappy Bird, we predict hazard rates and difficulty curves using automatic playtesting, Monte Carlo simulation, a player model based on human motor skills (precision and actions per second), and survival analysis of score histograms. We demonstrate our techniques using simulated game play and actual game data from over 106 million play sessions of a popular online Flappy Bird variant, showing quantitative reasons why balancing a game for a wide range of player skill can be difficult. Some applications of our techniques include searching for a specific difficulty, game space visualization, computational creativity to find unique variants, and tuning game balance to adjust the difficulty curve even when game parameters are time varying, score dependent, or changing based on game progress. 2017 IEEE.

    abstract = ""Game designers can use computer-aided game design methods to model how players may experience the perceived difficulty of a game. We present methods to generate and analyze the difficulty of a wide variety of minimal action game variants throughout game space, where each point in this abstract design space represents a unique game variant. Focusing on a parameterized version of Flappy Bird, we predict hazard rates and difficulty curves using automatic playtesting, Monte Carlo simulation, a player model based on human motor skills (precision and actions per second), and survival analysis of score histograms. We demonstrate our techniques using simulated game play and actual game data from over 106 million play sessions of a popular online Flappy Bird variant, showing quantitative reasons why balancing a game for a wide range of player skill can be difficult. Some applications of our techniques include searching for a specific difficulty, game space visualization, computational creativity to find unique variants, and tuning game balance to adjust the difficulty curve even when game parameters are time varying, score dependent, or changing based on game progress. 2017 IEEE.

724	GameSE_abstract	Crunch Time: The Reasons and Effects of Unpaid Overtime in the Games Industry	The games industry is notorious for its intense work ethics with uncompensated overtime and weekends at the office, also known as crunch or crunch time. Since crunch time is so common within the industry, is it possible that the benefits of crunch time outweigh the disadvantages? By studying postmortems and conducting interviews with employees in the industry, we aim to characterise crunch time and discover its effects on the industry. We provide a classification of crunch, i.e., four types of crunch which all have distinct characteristics and affect the product, employees and schedule in various ways. One of the crunch types stands out from the others by only having positive effects on product and schedule. A characteristic that all of the types have in common is an increase in stress levels amongst the employees. We identify a set of reasons for crunch and show that crunch is less pronounced in game studios where prioritisation of features is a regular practice.

727	GameSE_abstract	Development of game testing method for measuring game quality	The quality of game is one of the factors that may stop the release of a game. Game testing can be used to measure the game quality. Unfortunately, most game testing use user-centric approach to test the quality of the game. In this paper, we propose a game testing method, which is developed from the existing game testing approach supplemented with software testing approach to measure the game quality. The game quality was derived from software engineering quality model standards and game quality model. The proposed game testing method is applied to several case studies. The case studies have demonstrated how to assess the games in order to obtain the meaningful results. The research found that the game quality results can be used by game developers to improve the game.

728	GameSE_abstract	The Oracle Problem in Software Testing: A Survey	"Testing involves examining the behaviour of a system in order to discover potential faults. Given an input for a system, the challenge of distinguishing the corresponding desired, correct behaviour from potentially incorrect behavior is called the ""test oracle problem"". Test oracle automation is important to remove a current bottleneck that inhibits greater overall test automation. Without test oracle automation, the human has to determine whether observed behaviour is correct. The literature on test oracles has introduced techniques for oracle automation, including modelling, specifications, contract-driven development and metamorphic testing. When none of these is completely adequate, the final source of test oracle information remains the human, who may be aware of informal specifications, expectations, norms and domain specific information that provide informal oracle guidance. All forms of test oracles, even the humble human, involve challenges of reducing cost and increasing benefit. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of current approaches to the test oracle problem and an analysis of trends in this important area of software testing research and practice."

729	GameSE_abstract	RRT-based game level analysis, visualization, and visual refinement	Automating parts of game creation benefits both professional and amateur game designers and much previous work has already made progress on this front. In this paper we tackle automating level design. We describe a general graph-based representation for game levels and present a preliminary system that leverages this representation. Our system automatically explores existing levels of a 2D platform game using the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm and constructs a compact graph representation from this exploration. Our system can also modify a graph representation on-the-fly to reflect user-directed changes to the existing level structure. This work constitutes an initial step toward the larger goal of automating level design in a general way.

730	GameSE_abstract	The Evolution of the Platform Concept: A Systematic Review	Platforms have been considered as a paradigm for managing new product development and innovation. Since their introduction, studies on platforms have introduced multiple conceptualizations, leading to a fragmentation of research and different perspectives. By systematically reviewing the platform literature and combining bibliometric and content analyses, this paper examines the platform concept and its evolution, proposes a thematic classification, and highlights emerging trends in the literature. Based on this hybrid methodological approach (bibliometric and content analyses), the results show that platform research has primarily focused on issues that are mainly related to firms' internal aspects, such as innovation, modularity, commonality, and mass customization. Moreover, scholars have recently started to focus on new research themes, including managerial questions related to capability building, strategy, and ecosystem building based on platforms. As its main contributions, this paper improves the understanding of and clarifies the evolutionary trajectory of the platform concept, and identifies trends and emerging themes to be addressed in future studies.

732	GameSE_abstract	Software exclusivity and the scope of indirect network effects in the U.S. home video game market	This paper investigates the scope of indirect network effects in the home video game industry. We argue that the increasing prevalence of non-exclusive software gives rise to indirect network effects that exist between users of competing and incompatible hardware platforms. This is because software non-exclusivity, like hardware compatibility, allows a software firm to sell to a market broader than a single platform's installed base. We look for evidence of market-wide network effects by estimating a model of hardware demand and software supply. Our software supply equation allows the supply of games for a particular platform to depend not only on the installed base of that platform, but also on the installed base of competing platforms. Our results indicate the presence of both a platform-specific network effect and-in recent years-a cross-platform (or generation-wide) network effect. Our finding that the scope of indirect network effects in this industry has widened suggests one reason that this market, which is often cited as a canonical example of one with strong indirect network effects, is no longer dominated by a single platform.

733	GameSE_abstract	Real-time motion planning in the presence of moving obstacles	Safe operation of autonomous systems demands a collision-free motion trajectory at every time instant. This paper presents a method to calculate time-optimal motion trajectories for autonomous systems moving through an environment with both stationary and moving obstacles. To transform this motion planning problem into a small dimensional optimization problem, suitable for real-time optimization, the approach (i) uses a spline parameterization of the motion trajectory; and (ii) exploits spline properties to reduce the number of constraints. Solving this optimization problem with a receding horizon allows dealing with modeling errors and variations in the environment. In addition to extensive numerical simulations, the method is experimentally validated on a KUKA youBot. The average solving time of the optimization problem in the experiments is 0.05s, which is sufficiently fast for correcting deviations from the initial trajectory.

735	GameSE_abstract	Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning	Abstract:We present the first deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or learning algorithm. We find that it outperforms all previous approaches on six of the games and surpasses a human expert on three of them.

736	GameSE_abstract	An Overview of Serious Game Engines and Frameworks	Despite the growing popularity and widespread use of serious games, the development of effective serious games is difficult, requiring an appropriate balance between game design and instructional design. Although there are fundamental differences between games developed purely for entertainment compared to those developed for ``serious'' purposes, there are currently no standard development tools specifically intended for serious game design and development available that encourage developers to follow a set of best practices. Rather, developers of serious games often rely on existing game engines and frameworks that are specific to entertainment-based game development. Given the availability of a large number of game engines and frameworks, deciding on which one to use to develop a serious game may be difficult, yet the choice of engine or framework can play a significant role in the development process. In this paper we present the results of a literature review that examined the frameworks and game engines that are used to develop serious games. We provide a list of the most commonly used frameworks and game engines and summarize their features. Knowledge of the frameworks and game engines that are most popular and details regarding why they are popular may prove to be useful to serious games developers seeking such tools. The chapter ends with a brief discussion regarding a framework that is currently being developed specifically for the development of serious games. Through consultation with the potential users of the framework (serious games developers), the framework aims to strike a balance between ease of use and functionality, while providing the user with the necessary options and tools to ideally develop effective serious games.

737	GameSE_abstract	Tool support for the Test Template Framework	This paper describes tool support that has been implemented for the Test Template Framework (TTF). The TTF is a model-based testing (MBT) method that is especially well suited for unit testing from Z specifications. Although the TTF is a sound MBT method and it has been widely referenced since its first publication, attention in recent years has decayed. In fact, some have argued that generating abstract test cases following the TTF is a manual task requiring its users to perform complex predicate manipulations. This paper shows that these observations are dubious by describing Fastest, a tool that implements solutions for all these issues and, according to many experiments, produces abstract test cases for more than 80% of the satisfiable test specifications. Furthermore, it is claimed that Fastest fulfils the needs of the Z user community regarding MBT tools, which is supported with a range of case studies.	model-based testing; Test Template Framework; Z notation; Fastest; tool support	Cristia, Maximiliano; Albertengo, Pablo; Frydman, Claudia; Pluess, Brian; Rodriguez Monetti, Pablo	SOFTWARE TESTING VERIFICATION & RELIABILITY	https://doi.org/10.1002/stvr.1477		3-37			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2012	Tool support for the Test Template Framework	https://doi.org/10.1002/stvr.1477	WILEY	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
738	GameSE_abstract	Computational support for play testing game sketches	Early-stage game prototypes need to be informative without requiring excessive commitments. Paper prototypes are frequently used as a way of trying out core mechanics while leaving them easy to change. Play testing on even these early-stage prototypes can give an idea of how the rules play out and whether the game is fun and engaging. Recently, researchers have proposed using automated analysis of games to discover additional properties of games, such as exploits and other gameplay issues.		Adam M. Smith; Mark J.

739	GameSE_abstract	Hierarchical test generation: Where we are, and where we should be going	"Complex VLSI (very large scale integration) system design with VHDL requires test generation techniques that work at different levels in the abstraction hierarchy. The author discusses approaches to test generation which attempt to address this issue. Areas of test generation considered are behavior-assisted gate-level and switch-level test generation, test construction from sub-component tests, and test generation from behavioral models. The status of these methods and recommendations for future research and development are given, so that effective hierarchical test generation can become a reality.<

740	GameSE_abstract	License usage and changes: a large-scale study on gitHub	Open source software licenses determine, from a legal point of view, under which conditions software can be integrated and redistributed. The reason why developers of a project adopt (or change) a license may depend on various factors, e.g., the need for ensuring compatibility with certain third-party components, the perspective towards redistribution or commercialization of the software, or the need for protecting against somebody else's commercial usage of the software. This paper reports a large empirical study aimed at quantitatively and qualitatively investigating when and why developers adopt or change software licenses. Specifically, we first identify license changes in 1,731,828 commits, representing the entire history of 16,221 Java projects hosted on GitHub. Then, to understand the rationale of license changes, we perform a qualitative analysis on 1,160 projects written in seven different programming languages, namely C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, Python, and Ruby--following an open coding approach inspired by grounded theory--on commit messages and issue tracker discussions concerning licensing topics, and whenever possible, try to build traceability links between discussions and changes. On one hand, our results highlight how, in different contexts, license adoption or changes can be triggered by various reasons. On the other hand, the results also highlight a lack of traceability of when and why licensing changes are made. This can be a major concern, because a change in the license of a system can negatively impact those that reuse it. In conclusion, results of the study trigger the need for better tool support in guiding developers in choosing/changing licenses and in keeping track of the rationale of license changes.

On one hand, our results highlight how, in different contexts, license adoption or changes can be triggered by various reasons. On the other hand, the results also highlight a lack of traceability of when and why licensing changes are made. This can be a major concern, because a change in the license of a system can negatively impact those that reuse it. In conclusion, results of the study trigger the need for better tool support in guiding developers in choosing/changing licenses and in keeping track of the rationale of license changes.

741	GameSE_abstract	An Orchestrated Survey of Available Algorithms and Tools for Combinatorial Testing	For functional testing based on the input domain of a functionality, parameters and their values are identified and a test suite is generated using a criterion exercising combinations of those parameters and values. Since software systems are large, resulting in large numbers of parameters and values, a technique based on combinatorics called Combinatorial Testing (CT) is used to automate the process of creating those combinations. CT is typically performed with the help of combinatorial objects called Covering Arrays. The goal of the present work is to determine available algorithms/tools for generating a combinatorial test suite. We tried to be as complete as possible by using a precise protocol for selecting papers describing those algorithms/tools. The 75 algorithms/tools we identified are then categorized on the basis of different comparison criteria, including: the test suite generation technique, the support for selection (combination)criteria, mixed covering array, the strength of coverage, and the support for constraints between parameters. Results can be of interest to researchers or software companies who are looking for a CT algorithm/tool suitable for their needs.

742	GameSE_abstract	Game Engines and Game History	I have a problem: iti? 1/2s called preaching to the choir.  Nobody here lacks faith in the history of games, and I can only hope that my talk will not reduce your enthusiasm.  That realization eliminates the need for a homily on the value of historical studies.  Instead, I will talk about the possibilities and promises facing the history of games as we plunge forward. What does history offer game studies and what might a history of games give back? These questions guide my thoughts at the end of this conference, which has given so much food for these thoughts.	nan	Lowood, Henry	History of Games International Conference Proceedings	https://www.kinephanos.ca/2014/game-engines-and-game-history/	nan	20	nan		Excluded	snowballing			2	GoogleScholar	2014	Game Engines and Game History	https://www.kinephanos.ca/2014/game-engines-and-game-history/	Kinephanos	
743	GameSE_abstract	A framework for specification-based class testing	Class testing is the base of object-oriented software testing. It involves three aspects: testing each method, testing the relations among class methods and testing the inheriting relation between class and subclass. Rather than concerning the whole class testing process, most specification-based class testing focuses on the methods of generating test cases from the class specification. As a result, the class testing process and test cases cannot be unified and managed in a consistent and convenient way. This paper introduces a test class framework (TCF) that is used to structure the test cases and test deriving process of the class under testing. This framework clearly denotes the process of deriving test cases and test suites from a class specification. It facilitates the construction and management of test cases. Object-Z notation is used to express the framework and class specification.

744	GameSE_abstract	Res-RNN Network and Its Application in Case Text Recognition	To solve the problem of poor feature extraction ability of traditional text recognition methods in Chinese medical record text, this paper proposes a Res-RNN network for feature extraction based on residual error. Combined with residual characteristics, this network not only improves the depth of the network, but also ensures that there will be no degradation of the network, and strengthens the network's ability to extract Chinese character features. In the residual module, 1 x 1 convolution kernel is used to replace 3 x 3 convolution kernel, effectively reducing the parameters. Combined with feature maps of different scales, the feature information of Chinese characters at different levels is effectively utilized. According to the characteristics of Chinese characters, the vertical sensing field of the feature map is adjusted to retain more vertical fine-grained feature information, thus effectively improving the representational ability of the network. Experiments on actual Chinese medical record text image data set show that the accuracy of the proposed model is 4% higher than that of CRNN.

745	GameSE_abstract	Asymptotically Stabilizing Model Predictive Control for Hybrid Dynamical Systems	We present a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for hybrid dynamical systems. The proposed algorithm relies on a terminal constraint and a cost function, as well as a set-based notion of prediction horizon, reminiscent of free end-time optimal control problems. When the terminal cost is a control Lyapunov function (CLF) on the terminal constraint set, and the prediction horizon has a certain geometry, under standard assumptions from conventional MPC, the closed-loop system governed by MPC is shown to have an asymptotically stable compact set using the value function. A numerical example using the prototypical hybrid model of a bouncing ball demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

747	GameSE_abstract	Evolution of statistical analysis in empirical software engineering research: Current state and steps forward	Software engineering research is evolving and papers are increasingly based on empirical data from a multitude of sources, using statistical tests to determine if and to what degree empirical evidence supports their hypotheses. To investigate the practices and trends of statistical analysis in empirical software engineering (ESE), this paper presents a review of a large pool of papers from top-ranked software engineering journals. First, we manually reviewed 161 papers and in the second phase of our method, we conducted a more extensive semi-automatic classification of papers spanning the years 2001-2015 and 5196 papers. Results from both review steps was used to: i) identify and analyse the predominant practices in ESE (e.g., using t-test or ANOVA), as well as relevant trends in usage of specific statistical methods (e.g., nonparametric tests and effect size measures) and, ii) develop a conceptual model for a statistical analysis workflow with suggestions on how to apply different statistical methods as well as guidelines to avoid pitfalls. Lastly, we confirm existing claims that current ESE practices lack a standard to report practical significance of results. We illustrate how practical significance can be discussed in terms of both the statistical analysis and in the practitioner's context.

748	GameSE_abstract	The Unworkable Interface	"Interfaces are back, or perhaps they never left. The familiar So cratic conceit, from the Phaedrus, of communication as the process of writing directly on the soul of the other has, since the 1980s and 1990s, returned to center stage in the discourse around culture and media. The catoptrics of the society of the spectacle is now the dioptrics of the society of control. Reflective surfaces have been overthrown by transparent thresholds. The metal detector arch, or the graphics frustum, or the Unix socket?these are the new emblems of the age. Windows, doors, airport gates, and other thresholds are those trans parent devices that achieve more the less they do: for every moment of virtuosic immersion and connectivity, for every moment of volumetric delivery, of inopacity, the threshold becomes one notch more invisible, one notch more inoperable. As technology, the more a dioptric device erases the traces of its own functioning (in actually delivering the thing represented beyond), the more it succeeds in its functional mandate; yet this very achievement undercuts the ultimate goal: the more intui tive a device becomes, the more it risks falling out of media altogether, becoming as naturalized as air or as common as dirt. To succeed, then, is at best self-deception and at worst self-annihilation. One must work hard to cast the glow of unwork. Operability engenders inoperability. Curiously this is not a chronological, spatial, or even semiotic relation. It is primarily a systemic relation, as Michel Serres rightly observed in his meditation on functional alongsidedness"": ""Systems work because they don't work. Non-functionality remains essential for functionality. This can be formalized: pretend there are two stations exchanging messages through a channel. If the exchange succeeds?if it is perfect, optimal, immediate?then the relation erases itself. But if the relation remains"""		Galloway, Alexander R.

750	GameSE_abstract	Identifying Failure-Inducing Combinations in a Combinatorial Test Set	A t-way combinatorial test set is designed to detect failures that are triggered by combinations involving no more than t parameters. Assume that we have executed a t-way test set and some tests have failed. A natural question to ask is: What combinations have caused these failures? Identifying such combinations can facilitate the debugging effort, e.g., by reducing the scope of the code that needs to be inspected. In this paper, we present an approach to identifying failure-inducing combinations, i.e., combinations that have caused some tests to fail. Given a t-way test set, our approach first identifies and ranks a set of suspicious combinations, which are candidates that are likely to be failure-inducing combinations. Next, it generates a set of new tests, which can be executed to refine the ranking of suspicious combinations in the next iteration. This process can be repeated until a stopping condition is satisfied. We conducted an experiment in which our approach was applied to several benchmark programs. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively and efficiently identify failure-inducing combinations in these programs.

751	GameSE_abstract	Entrepreneurship in digital platforms: A network-centric view	Research summary: Research on entrepreneurship has focused primarily on the individual characteristics of founders in driving the success of new ventures offering stand-alone products and/or services. In recent years, we have seen an increase in entrepreneurship in digital platforms--where success requires positioning products and services within dynamic digital networks that depict complex connections among platforms, complementary modules, and consumers. This article introduces key elements of a theory for settings where entrepreneurship success is intricately connected to the moves of other entrepreneurs and coordinated within and across platforms. We introduce a network-centric view to understand how entrepreneurs occupying the role of third-party developers support digital platforms by their choices to link to them. Furthermore, we develop propositions reflecting a dynamic perspective representing two key stages of competition in digital platforms, initial launch, and scale-up. We hope this work guides further theorizing and empirical research in digital platforms and entrepreneurship in general. Managerial summary: Over the last decade, we have seen a rise in digital entrepreneurs who support platforms such as Apple iOS, Google's Android, Facebook, Twitter, and others. The success of platforms requires support from applications, and entrepreneurs in such settings play a critical role in making some platforms succeed relative to others. Our study provides insight into how digital entrepreneurs can orchestrate strategic moves that allow them to navigate the complex landscape of linking and adapting to different platforms and how these linkage choices can lead to entrepreneurial success.	complementors;; digital platforms;; entrepreneurship;; modularity;; networks;; technology	Srinivasan, Arati; Venkatraman, N.

753	GameSE_abstract	Beyond the HUD - User Interfaces for Increased Player Immersion in FPS Games	The concept of immersion has been adapted by game developers and game critics to describe a deep and positive game experience. While the definition of this concept varies, the user interface of the game is often said to affect the degree to which players can immerse themselves in a game experience. In cooperation with game developer EA DICE, this master thesis aims to investigate how the notion of immersion affects, and is affected by, the user interface (UI) of first-person shooter games, with the ultimate purpose of delivering user interface guidelines for increased immersion. By conducting a study of contemporary first-person shooter (FPS) games, the current state of user interfaces in FPS games is documented. With the addition of a subjective study of FPS games as well as games of other genres, a design space for UI designers is mapped out in order to provide a structure upon which the guidelines can be built. A literature study of various resources within the fields of ludology, cognitive science and media studies is conducted in order to gain increased understanding of what immersion is and its relation to the game experience. The knowledge acquired is used to formulate various hypotheses of how player immersion is connected to the user interfaces of FPS games. These hypotheses are evaluated by user studies and user tests. Looking at the results of the user tests and the literature study, a final definition of immersion is proposed, upon which the guidelines are based. The first guideline, Know Your Design Space, explains the user interface design space of FPS games and encourages UI designers to look at it as a set of tools. Know Your Game discusses how the competitive focus of the game and the game fiction affects the user interface from an immersion point of view. The guideline Establish Player Agency focuses on how the player can be transferred into the game world by acting within it as an agent rather than simply a player of the game. Finally, Strengthen the Player-Avatar Perceptual Link suggests how the user interface can link the player closer to his in-game character on a perceptual level.

755	GameSE_abstract	Combinatorial testing for software: An adaptation of design of experiments	Software has become increasingly ubiquitous in tools and methods used for science, engineering, medicine, commerce, and human interactions. Extensive testing is required to assure that software works correctly. Combinatorial testing is a versatile methodology which is useful in a broad range of situations to detect faults in software. It is based on the insight that while the behavior of a software system may be affected by a large number of factors, only a few factors are involved in a failure-inducing fault. We discuss the development of combinatorial testing for software as adaptation of design of experiment methods. Combinatorial testing began as pairwise testing in which first orthogonal arrays and then covering arrays were used to make sure that all pairs of the test settings were tested. Subsequent investigations of actual software failures showed that pairwise (2-way) testing may not always be sufficient and combinatorial t-way testing for t greater than 2 may be needed. Until recently efficient tools for generating test suites for combinatorial t-way testing were not widely available. Combinatorial testing has become practical because efficient and free downloadable tools with support of constraints have become available. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

756	GameSE_abstract	Coding together at scale: GitHub as a collaborative social network	GitHub is the most popular repository for open source code (Finley 2011). It has more than 3.5 million users, as the company declared in April 2013, and more than 10 million repositories, as of December 2013. It has a publicly accessible API and, since March 2012, it also publishes a stream of all the events occurring on public projects. Interactions among GitHub users are of a complex nature and take place in different forms. Developers create and fork repositories, push code, approve code pushed by others, bookmark their favorite projects and follow other developers to keep track of their activities. In this paper we present a characterization of GitHub, as both a social network and a collaborative platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study about the interactions happening on GitHub. We analyze the logs from the service over 18 months (between March 11, 2012 and September 11, 2013), describing 183.54 million events and we obtain information about 2.19 million users and 5.68 million repositories, both growing linearly in time. We show that the distributions of the number of contributors per project, watchers per project and followers per user show a power-law-like shape. We analyze social ties and repository-mediated collaboration patterns, and we observe a remarkably low level of reciprocity of the social connections. We also measure the activity of each user in terms of authored events and we observe that very active users do not necessarily have a large number of followers. Finally, we provide a geographic characterization of the centers of activity and we investigate how distance influences collaboration.

757	GameSE_abstract	Platform competition: Strategic trade-offs in platform markets	Because the literature on platform competition emphasizes the role of network effects, it prescribes rapidly expanding a network of platform users and complementary applications to capture entire markets. We challenge the unconditional logic of a winner-take-all (WTA) approach by empirically analyzing the dominant strategies used to build and position platform systems in the U.S. video game industry. We show that when platform firms pursue two popular WTA strategies concurrently and with equal intensity (growing the number and variety of applications while also securing a larger fraction of those applications with exclusivity agreements), it diminishes the benefits of each strategy to the point that it lowers platform performance. We also show that a differentiation strategy based on distinctive positioning improves a platform's performance only when a platform system is highly distinctive relative to its rivals. Our results suggest that platform competition is shaped by important strategic trade-offs and that the WTA approach will not be universally successful.	ecosystem; multisided markets; platform competition; platform positioning; strategic trade-offs; winner take all	Cennamo, Carmelo; Santalo, Juan	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL	https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.2066		1331-1350			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2013	Platform competition: Strategic trade-offs in platform markets	https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.2066	WILEY	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
758	GameSE_abstract	HyPED:modeling and analyzing action games as hybrid systems	Platformers and action-adventure games have high-dimensional state spaces with difficult, non-linear constraints on character movement; even worse, game environments often respond to the player in complex ways that can cause exponential expansion of the planning search space. Planning problems in these high-dimensional spaces generally require domain-specific knowledge and manually abstracted models of game rules to replicate the intuition of human designers or playtesters. In this work, we outline a system for modeling these complex games at a precise and low level in terms of hybrid automata. With this representation, standard incremental search algorithms can be used to answer reachable-region queries, taking advantage of the domain information embedded in the system.		Joseph C.

Method: We have conducted an online survey among industry practitioners and asked them how and for what purposes they use models.

761	GameSE_abstract	On the use of software design models in software development practice: An empirical investigation	Research into software design models in general, and into the UML in particular, focuses on answering the question how design models are used, completely ignoring the question if they are used. There is an assumption in the literature that the UML is the de facto standard, and that use of design models has had a profound and substantial effect on how software is designed by virtue of models giving the ability to do model-checking, code generation, or automated test generation. However for this assumption to be true, there has to be significant use of design models in practice by developers.This paper presents the results of a survey summarizing the answers of 3785 developers answering the simple question on the extent to which design models are used before coding. We relate their use of models with (i) total years of programming experience, (ii) open or closed development, (iii) educational level, (iv) programming language used, and (v) development type.The answer to our question was that design models are not used very extensively in industry, and where they are used, the use is informal and without tool support, and the notation is often not UML. The use of models decreased with an increase in experience and increased with higher level of qualification. Overall we found that models are used primarily as a communication and collaboration mechanism where there is a need to solve problems and/or get a joint understanding of the overall design in a group. We also conclude that models are seldom updated after initially created and are usually drawn on a whiteboard or on paper.

The analysis and understanding of events, mistakes, and fluxes of a concrete game play may be useful for different reasons: understanding problems related to gameplay, data mining of specific situations, and even understanding educational and learning aspects in serious games. We introduce a novel approach based on provenance concepts in order to model and represent a game flux. We model the game data and map it to provenance to generate a provenance graph for analysis. As an example, we also instantiated our proposed conceptual framework and graph generation in a serious game, allowing developers and designers to identify possible mistakes and failures in gameplay design by analyzing the generated provenance graph from collected gameplay data.

The selections of the applied tools are based on their ability to test concepts and build prototypes to help design.Conclusion:In general, the game development organizations expect their tools to allow adaptability to changes during the development process. The case companies did not seem to have many problems with their current technical infrastructure, and ability to test different solutions was considered very important feature.	development tools; game industry; software development; technical infrastructure	Jussi Kasurinen; Jukka-Pekka Stranden; Kari Smolander	EASE '13: Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering	https://doi.org/10.1145/2460999.2461004		36-41			Included	snowballing			2	ACM	2013	What do game developers expect from development and design tools	https://doi.org/10.1145/2460999.2461004	Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
764	GameSE_abstract	A survey on modeling and model-driven engineering practices in the embedded software industry	"Software-intensive embedded systems have become an essential aspect of our lives. To cope with its growing complexity, modeling and model-driven engineering (MDE) are widely used for analysis, design, implementation, and testing of these systems. Since a large variety of software modeling practices is used in the domain of embedded software, it is important to understand and characterize the-state-of-the-practices and also the benefits, challenges and consequences of using software modeling approaches in this domain. The goal of this study is to investigate those practices in the embedded software engineering projects by identifying to what degree, why and how software modeling and MDE are used. To achieve this objective, we designed and conducted an online survey. Opinions of 627 practicing embedded software engineers from 27 different countries are included in the survey. The survey results reveal important and interesting findings about the state of software modeling and MDE practices in the worldwide embedded software industry. Among the results: (1) Different modeling approaches (from informal sketches to formalized models) are widely used in the embedded software industry with different needs and all of the usages could be effective depending on the various modeling characteristics; (2) The majority of participants use UML; and the second most frequently selected response is ""Sketch/No formal modeling language"" which shows the wide-spread informal usage of modeling; (3) In model-driven approaches, it is not so important to have a graphical syntax to represent the model (as in UML) and depending on the type of target embedded industrial sector, modeling stakeholders prefer models, which can be represented in a format that is readable by a machine (as in DSL); (4) Sequence diagrams and state-machines are the two most popular diagram types; (5) Top motivations for adopting MDE are: cost savings, achieving shorter development time, reusability and quality improvement. The survey results will shed light on the state of software modeling and MDE practices and provide practical benefits to embedded software professionals (e.g., practitioners, researchers and also educators)."

765	GameSE_abstract	Program comprehension of domain-specific and general-purpose languages: replication of a family of experiments using integrated development environments	Domain-specific languages (DSLs) allow developers to write code at a higher level of abstraction compared with general-purpose languages (GPLs). Developers often use DSLs to reduce the complexity of GPLs. Our previous study found that developers performed program comprehension tasks more accurately and efficiently with DSLs than with corresponding APIs in GPLs. This study replicates our previous study to validate and extend the results when developers use IDEs to perform program comprehension tasks. We performed a dependent replication of a family of experiments. We made two specific changes to the original study: (1) participants used IDEs to perform the program comprehension tasks, to address a threat to validity in the original experiment and (2) each participant performed program comprehension tasks on either DSLs or GPLs, not both as in the original experiment. The results of the replication are consistent with and expanded the results of the original study. Developers are significantly more effective and efficient in tool-based program comprehension when using a DSL than when using a corresponding API in a GPL. The results indicate that, where a DSL is available, developers will perform program comprehension better using the DSL than when using the corresponding API in a GPL.

Developers are significantly more effective and efficient in tool-based program comprehension when using a DSL than when using a corresponding API in a GPL. The results indicate that, where a DSL is available, developers will perform program comprehension better using the DSL than when using the corresponding API in a GPL.

766	GameSE_abstract	Accelerated aging and contact degradation of CIGS solar cells	"The long-term stability of solar cells is a crucial factor for the competitiveness of a technology. In this study, the accelerated aging of CIGS solar cells was studied, and the influence of an applied bias during the endurance test on the open-circuit voltage V
oc
 and fill factor (FF) was investigated. Time constants for parameter drifts of the open-circuit voltage and the associated activation energy were determined. The observed parameter drifts will be discussed, and a model will be proposed based on SCAPS simulations, explaining the observed behavior of the electrical characteristics of the solar cells. Therefore, cells were dark annealed under dry conditions at two different temperatures and different voltage biases were applied to the cells. Our study revealed that the application of a positive bias, which is similar to light soaking, first leads to an improvement and stabilization of the open-circuit voltage and FF followed by a slow decrease of these parameters. This long-term decrease can be explained in terms of a back barrier or phototransistor, as simulated with SCAPS. However, applying a positive bias enhances the long-term stability of these devices. The appearance of a back barrier is associated with a time constant exceeding 30 years. Therefore, this degradation mechanism is not critical."

769	GameSE_abstract	An experimental comparison of ER and UML class diagrams for data modelling	We present the results of three sets of controlled experiments aimed at analysing whether UML class diagrams are more comprehensible than ER diagrams during data models maintenance. In particular, we considered the support given by the two notations in the comprehension and interpretation of data models, comprehension of the change to perform to meet a change request, and detection of defects contained in a data model. The experiments involved university students with different levels of ability and experience. The results demonstrate that using UML class diagrams subjects achieved better comprehension levels. With regard to the support given by the two notations during maintenance activities the results demonstrate that the two notations give the same support, while in general UML class diagrams provide a better support with respect to ER diagrams during verification activities.

770	GameSE_abstract	How Test Organizations Adopt New Testing Practices and Methods?	Software testing process is an activity, in which the software is verified to comply with the requirements and validated to operate as intended. As software development adopts new development methods, this means also that the test processes need to be changed. In this qualitative study, we observe ten software organizations to understand how organizations develop their test processes and how they adopt new test methods. Based on our observations, organizations do only sporadic test process development, and are conservative when adopting new ideas or testing methods. Organizations need to have a clear concept of what to develop and how to implement the needed changes before they commit to process development.

771	GameSE_abstract	Guns, swords and data: Clustering of player behavior in computer games in the wild	Behavioral data from computer games can be exceptionally high-dimensional, of massive scale and cover a temporal segment reaching years of real-time and a varying population of users. Clustering of user behavior provides a way to discover behavioral patterns that are actionable for game developers. Interpretability and reliability of clustering results is vital, as decisions based on them affect game design and thus ultimately revenue. Here case studies are presented focusing on clustering analysis applied to high-dimensionality player behavior telemetry, covering a combined total of 260,000 characters from two major commercial game titles: the Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game Tera and the multi-player strategy war game Battlefield 2: Bad Company 2. K-means and Simplex Volume Maximization clustering were applied to the two datasets, combined with considerations of the design of the games, resulting in actionable behavioral profiles. Depending on the algorithm different insights into the underlying behavior of the population of the two games are provided.

773	GameSE_abstract	Performance testing modeling: an empirical evaluation of DSL and UML-based approaches	Performance testing modeling is a relative new research field. Researches investigating how to apply models to document performance testing information essentially started to be reported in the last decade. Motivated by the lack of a standard to represent performance testing information, our research group, in collaboration with an IT company, proposed a UML approach and lately a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to support performance testing modeling. The goal of this paper is to show how we support our partner company on the decision process to replace UML by a DSL, hence we designed and conducted an experimental study to provide evidence about the benefits and drawbacks when using UML or DSL for modeling performance testing. In this paper, we report an in vitro experiment, where the subjects designed UML models and DSL models, for the purpose of evaluation with respect to the effort and suitability, from the perspective of the performance testers and the performance engineers in the context of industry and academia for modeling performance testing. Our results indicate that, for performance modeling, effort using a DSL was lower than using UML. Our statistical analysis showed that the results were valid, i.e., that to design performance testing models using our DSL is better than using UML.	performance testing;  experiment;  domain-specific language	Bernardino, Maicon; Rodrigues, Elder M.; Zorzo, Avelino F.

    abstract = ""Performance testing modeling is a relative new research field. Researches investigating how to apply models to document performance testing information essentially started to be reported in the last decade. Motivated by the lack of a standard to represent performance testing information, our research group, in collaboration with an IT company, proposed a UML approach and lately a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to support performance testing modeling. The goal of this paper is to show how we support our partner company on the decision process to replace UML by a DSL, hence we designed and conducted an experimental study to provide evidence about the benefits and drawbacks when using UML or DSL for modeling performance testing. In this paper, we report an in vitro experiment, where the subjects designed UML models and DSL models, for the purpose of evaluation with respect to the effort and suitability, from the perspective of the performance testers and the performance engineers in the context of industry and academia for modeling performance testing. Our results indicate that, for performance modeling, effort using a DSL was lower than using UML. Our statistical analysis showed that the results were valid, i.e., that to design performance testing models using our DSL is better than using UML."",

774	GameSE_abstract	Evaluating the Benefits of Model-Driven Development	Researchers have been evaluating the benefits of Model-Driven Development (MDD) for more than a decade now. Although some works suggest that MDD decreases development time, other works limit MDD benefits to academic exercises and to developers without experience. To clarify the benefits of MDD, we present the results of our experiment, which compares MDD and Code-centric Development (CcD) in terms of correctness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Our experiment achieves fidelity to real-world settings because the tasks are taken from real-world video game development, and the subjects use domain frameworks as they are used in real-world developments. Our results challenge previous ideas that limit the benefits of MDD to academic exercises and to developers without experience. Furthermore, our results also suggest that understanding the benefits of MDD might require researchers to rethink their experiments to include the social part of software development.

775	GameSE_abstract	An innovative approach to the development of an international software process lifecycle standard for very small entities	For very small software development companies, the quality of their software products is a key to competitive advantage. However, the usage of Software Engineering standards is extremely low amongst such very small software companies. A primary reason cited by many such companies for this lack of quality standards adoption is the perception that they have been developed for large multi-national software companies and not with small and very small organizations in mind and are therefore not suitable for their specific needs. This paper describes an innovative systematic approach to the development of the software process lifecycle standard for very small entities ISO/IEC 29110, following the Rogers model of the Innovation-Development process. The ISO/IEC 29110 standard is unique amongst software and systems engineering standards, in that the working group mandated to develop a new standard approached industry to conduct a needs assessment and gather actual requirements for a new standard as part of the standards development process. This paper presents a unique insight from the perspective of some of the standards authors on the development of the ISO/IEC 29110 standard, including the rationale behind its development and the innovative design of implementation guides to assist very small companies in adopting the standards, as well outlining a pilot project scheme for usage in early trials of this standard.

777	GameSE_abstract	Towards Measuring the Impact of the ISO/IEC 29110 Standard: A Systematic Review	The software industry recognizes the value of VSEs in contributing valuable products and services. Unfortunately current ISO/IEC standards do not completely address the needs of VSEs. Due to this, the ISO/IEC 29110 standard has been developed. The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of the initiative by means of a systematic literature review of the ISO/IEC 29110 standard. This analysis was conducted using the most significant bibliographic databases. The result of the analysis reflects some tendencies in research that target the development of software process assessment and SIP models for supporting the standard, the performance, creation and utilization of deployment packages, pilot projects and ISO/IEC 29110 standard implementation approaches, the encouragement on concluding the remaining profiles or the creation of new profiles and the design, development and implementation of documentation and knowledge management tools in order to support the adoption of the standard by VSEs.

778	GameSE_abstract	A Brazilian survey on UML and model-driven practices for embedded software development	This paper brings statistical findings from a survey about the use of UML modeling and model-driven approaches for the design of embedded software in Brazil. The survey provides evidences regarding the maturity of use of UML and model-driven approaches, how they are employed, and which and where the professionals who use them are. Technical, organizational, and social aspects were investigated and documented by making use of a descriptive research method. Such aspects seemingly reflect the opinions of software engineers on how they perceive the impact of using UML and model-driven approaches on productivity and quality in embedded software development. Results show that most participants are clearly aware of the modeling approach value, even though they practice it only to a limited degree. Most respondents who make use of model-driven approaches attest that productivity and portability are the key advantages of their use.

781	GameSE_abstract	Feature-based projections for effective playtrace analysis	Visual data mining is a powerful technique allowing game designers to analyze player behavior. Playtracer, a new method for visually analyzing play traces, is a generalized heatmap that applies to any game with discrete state spaces. Unfortunately, due to its low discriminative power, Playtracer's usefulness is significantly decreased for games of even medium complexity, and is unusable on games with continuous state spaces. Here we show how the use of state features can remove both of these weaknesses. These state features collapse larger state spaces without losing salient information, resulting in visualizations that are significantly easier to interpret. We evaluate our work by analyzing player data gathered from three complex games in order to understand player behavior in the presence of optional rewards, identify key moments when players figure out the solution to the puzzle, and analyze why players give up and quit. Based on our experiences with these games, we suggest general principles for designers to identify useful features of game states that lead to effective play analyses.	visual data mining;  games;  game design	Liu, Yun-En; Andersen, Erik; Snider, Richard; Cooper, Seth; Popovi\'{c}, Zoran	FDG '11: Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Foundations of Digital Games	https://doi.org/10.1145/2159365.2159375		69-76	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2159365.2159375,

782	GameSE_abstract	A Controlled Experiment with Novice Developers on the Impact of Task Description Granularity on Software Quality in Test-Driven Development	Background: Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an iterative software development process characterized by test-code-refactor cycle. TDD recommends that developers work on small and manageable tasks at each iteration. However, the ability to break tasks into small work items effectively is a learned skill that improves with experience. In experimental studies of TDD, the granularity of task descriptions is an overlooked factor. In particular, providing a more granular task description in terms of a set of sub-tasks versus providing a coarser-grained, generic description. Objective: We aim to investigate the impact of task description granularity on the outcome of TDD, as implemented by novice developers, with respect to software quality, as measured by functional correctness and functional completeness. Method: We conducted a one-factor crossover experiment with 48 graduate students in an academic environment. Each participant applied TDD and implemented two tasks, where one of the tasks was presented using a more granular task description. Resulting artifacts were evaluated with acceptance tests to assess functional correctness and functional completeness. Linear mixed-effects models (LMM) were used for analysis. Results: Software quality improved significantly when participants applied TDD using more granular task descriptions. The effect of task description granularity is statistically significant and had a medium to large effect size. Moreover, the task was found to be a significant predictor of software quality which is an interesting result (because two tasks used in the experiment were considered to be of similar complexity). Conclusion: For novice TDD practitioners, the outcome of TDD is highly coupled with the ability to break down the task into smaller parts. For researchers, task selection and task description granularity requires more attention in the design of TDD experiments. Task description granularity should be taken into account in secondary studies. Further comparative studies are needed to investigate whether task descriptions affect other development processes similarly.

783	GameSE_abstract	Diagnose crashing faults on production software	Software crashes are severe manifestations of software faults. Especially, software crashes in production software usually result in bad user experiences. Therefore, crashing faults mostly are required to be fixed with a high priority. Diagnosing crashing faults on production software is non-trivial, due to the characteristics of production environment. In general, it is required to address two major challenges. First, crash reports in production software are usually numerous, since production software is used by a large number of end users in various environments and configurations. Especially, a single fault may manifest as different crash reports, which makes the prioritizing debugging and understanding faults difficult. Second, deployed software is required to run with minimal overhead and cannot afford a heavyweight instrumentation approach to collect program execution information. Furthermore, end users require that the logged information should not reveal sensitive production data. This thesis contributes for developing crashing fault diagnosis tools that can be used in production environment.

For long-running experiments or when provenance is captured at a low granularity, this analysis process can be overwhelming to the user due to the large volume of provenance data. In this paper we introduce, Prov Viewer, a provenance visualization tool that enables users to interactively explore provenance data. Among the visualization and exploratory features, we can cite zooming, filtering, and coloring. Moreover, we use of other properties such as shape and size to distinguish visual elements. These exploratory features are linked to the provenance semantics to ease the comprehension process. We also introduce collapsing and filtering strategies, allowing different levels of granularity exploration and analysis. We describe case studies that show how Prov Viewer has been successfully used to explore provenance in different domains, including games and urban data.

785	GameSE_abstract	Crossover Designs in Software Engineering Experiments: Benefits and Perils	In experiments with crossover design subjects apply more than one treatment. Crossover designs are widespread in software engineering experimentation: they require fewer subjects and control the variability among subjects. However, some researchers disapprove of crossover designs. The main criticisms are: the carryover threat and its troublesome analysis. Carryover is the persistence of the effect of one treatment when another treatment is applied later. It may invalidate the results of an experiment. Additionally, crossover designs are often not properly designed and/or analysed, limiting the validity of the results. In this paper, we aim to make SE researchers aware of the perils of crossover experiments and provide risk avoidance good practices. We study how another discipline (medicine) runs crossover experiments. We review the SE literature and discuss which good practices tend not to be adhered to, giving advice on how they should be applied in SE experiments. We illustrate the concepts discussed analysing a crossover experiment that we have run. We conclude that crossover experiments can yield valid results, provided they are properly designed and analysed, and that, if correctly addressed, carryover is no worse than other validity threats.

    abstract = ""In experiments with crossover design subjects apply more than one treatment. Crossover designs are widespread in software engineering experimentation: they require fewer subjects and control the variability among subjects. However, some researchers disapprove of crossover designs. The main criticisms are: the carryover threat and its troublesome analysis. Carryover is the persistence of the effect of one treatment when another treatment is applied later. It may invalidate the results of an experiment. Additionally, crossover designs are often not properly designed and/or analysed, limiting the validity of the results. In this paper, we aim to make SE researchers aware of the perils of crossover experiments and provide risk avoidance good practices. We study how another discipline (medicine) runs crossover experiments. We review the SE literature and discuss which good practices tend not to be adhered to, giving advice on how they should be applied in SE experiments. We illustrate the concepts discussed analysing a crossover experiment that we have run. We conclude that crossover experiments can yield valid results, provided they are properly designed and analysed, and that, if correctly addressed, carryover is no worse than other validity threats.

786	GameSE_abstract	Empirical evidence about the UML: a systematic literature review	The Unified Modeling Language (UML) was created on the basis of expert opinion and has now become accepted as the 'standard' object-oriented modelling notation. Our objectives were to determine how widely the notations of the UML, and their usefulness, have been studied empirically, and to identify which aspects of it have been studied in most detail. We undertook a mapping study of the literature to identify relevant empirical studies and to classify them in terms of the aspects of the UML that they studied. We then conducted a systematic literature review, covering empirical studies published up to the end of 2008, based on the main categories identified. We identified 49 relevant publications, and report the aggregated results for those categories for which we had enough papers-metrics, comprehension, model quality, methods and tools and adoption. Despite indications that a number of problems exist with UML models, researchers tend to use the UML as a 'given' and seem reluctant to ask questions that might help to make it more effective.

788	GameSE_abstract	How effective is UML modeling ?	Modeling has become a common practice in modern software engineering. Since the mid 1990s the Unified Modeling Language (UML) has become the de facto standard for modeling software systems. The UML is used in all phases of software development: ranging from the requirement phase to the maintenance phase. However, empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of modeling in software development is few and far apart. This paper aims to synthesize empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of modeling using UML in software development, with a special focus on the cost and benefits.

Use of outputs from the model and a 3D visualisation of the development can help decision-makers judge the relative sustainability of different aspects of a development. The tool employs a number of different methods to present sustainability results to stakeholders.

791	GameSE_abstract	Citation and Topic Analysis of the ESEM Papers	Context: The pool of papers published in ESEM. Objective: To utilize citation analysis and automated topic analysis to characterize the SE research literature over the years focusing on those papers published in ESEM. Method: We collected data from Scopus database consisting of 513 ESEM papers. For thematic analysis, we used topic modeling to automatically generate the most probable topic distributions given the data. Results: Nearly 42% of the papers have not been cited at all but the effect seems to wear off as time passes. Using text mining of article titles and abstracts, we found that currently the most popular research topics in the ESEM community are: systematic reviews, testing, defects, cost estimation, and team work. Conclusions: While this study analyzes the paper pool of the ESEM symposium, the approach can easily be applied to any other sub-set of SE papers to conduct large scale studies. Due to large volumes of research in SE, we suggest using the automated analysis of bibliometrics as we have done in this paper.

While empirical studies on the use and the e?ects of MBE in industry generally exist, there is only little work targeting the embedded systems domain. We contribute to the body of knowledge with a study on the use and the assessment of MBE in that particular domain. Therefore, we collected quantitative data from 112 subjects, mostly professionals working with MBE, with the goal to assess the current State of Practice and the challenges the embedded systems domain is facing. Of the 112 subjects, the majority are experienced with MBE, working at large companies in the automotive, avionics, or healthcare domains. Additionally, mainly OEMs and First-tier suppliers are represented in the study. Our main findings are that MBE is used by a majority of all participants in the embedded systems domain, mainly for simulation, code generation, and documentation. Reported positive e?ects of MBE are higher quality and improved reusability. Main shortcomings are interoperability difficulties between MBE tools, high training e?ort for developers and usability issues. The data also shows that there are no large di?erences between subgroups with respect to domains, position in the value chain, company size and product size.	nan	Marko, Nadja; Liebel, Grischa; Sauter, Daniel; Lodwich, Aleksander; Tichy, Matthias; Leitner, Andrea; Hansson, Jorgen	Software Engineering & Management	https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/37424	nan	nan	nan		Excluded	snowballing			2	GoogleScholar	2014	Model-based engineering for embedded systems in practice	https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/37424	University of Gothenburg

795	GameSE_abstract	Understanding Reliability and Validity in Qualitative Research	The use of reliability and validity are common in quantitative research and now it is reconsidered in the qualitative research paradigm. Since reliability and validity are rooted in positivist perspective then they should be redefined for their use in a naturalistic approach. Like reliability and validity as used in quantitative research are providing springboard to examine what these two terms mean in the qualitative research paradigm, triangulation as used in quantitative research to test the reliability and validity can also illuminate some ways to test or maximize the validity and reliability of a qualitative study. Therefore, reliability, validity and triangulation, if they are relevant research concepts, particularly from a qualitative point of view, have to be redefined in order to reflect the multiple ways of establishing truth.

796	GameSE_abstract	Glyph: Visualization Tool for Understanding Problem Solving Strategies in Puzzle Games	Abstract:Understanding player strategies is a key question when analyzing player behavior both for academic researchers and industry practitioners. For game designers and game user researchers, it is important to gauge the distance between intended strategies and emergent strategies; this comparison allows identification of glitches or undesirable behaviors. For academic researchers using games for serious purposes such as education, the strategies adopted by players are indicative of their cognitive progress in relation to serious goals, such as learning process. Current techniques and systems created to address these needs present a few drawbacks. Qualitative methods are difficult to scale upwards to include large number of players and are prone to subjective biases. Other approaches such as visualization and analytical tools are either designed to provide an aggregated overview of the data, losing the nuances of individual player behaviors, or, in the attempt of accounting for individual behavior, are not specifically designed to reduce the visual cognitive load. In this work, we propose a novel visualization technique that specifically addresses the tasks of comparing behavior sequences in order to capture an overview of the strategies enacted by players and at the same time examine individual player behaviors to identify differences and outliers. This approach allows users to form hypotheses about player strategies and verify them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique through a case study: utilizing a prototype system to investigate data collected from a commercial educational puzzle game. While the prototype's usability can be improved, initial testing results show that core features of the system proved useful to our potential users for understanding player strategies.

797	GameSE_abstract	Immersive and non immersive 3D virtual city: Decision support tool for urban sustainability	Sustainable urban planning decisions must not only consider the physical structure of the urban development but the economic, social and environmental factors. Due to the prolonged times scales of major urban development projects the current and future impacts of any decision made must be fully understood. Many key project decisions are made early in the decision making process with decision makers later seeking agreement for proposals once the key decisions have already been made, leaving many stakeholders, especially the general public, feeling marginalised by the process. Many decision support tools have been developed to aid in the decision making process, however many of these are expert orientated, fail to fully address spatial and temporal issues and do not reflect the interconnectivity of the separate domains and their indicators. This paper outlines a platform that combines computer game techniques, modelling of economic, social and environmental indicators to provide an interface that presents a 3D interactive virtual city with sustainability information overlain. Creating a virtual 3D urban area using the latest video game techniques ensures: real-time rendering of the 3D graphics; exploitation of novel techniques of how complex multivariate data is presented to the user; immersion in the 3D urban development, via first person navigation, exploration and manipulation of the environment with consequences updated in real-time. The use of visualisation techniques begins to remove sustainability assessment's reliance on the existing expert systems which are largely inaccessible to many of the stakeholder groups, especially the general public.

798	GameSE_abstract	Modeling Player Experience for Content Creation	In this paper, we use computational intelligence techniques to built quantitative models of player experience for a platform game. The models accurately predict certain key affective states of the player based on both gameplay metrics that relate to the actions performed by the player in the game, and on parameters of the level that was played. For the experiments presented here, a version of the classicSuper Mario Brosgame is enhanced with parameterizable level generation and gameplay metrics collection. Player pairwise preference data is collected using forced choice questionnaires, and the models are trained using this data and neuroevolutionary preference learning of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). The derived models will be used to optimize design parameters for particular types of player experience, allowing the designer to automatically generate unique levels that induce the desired experience for the player.

Visualizations have become a promising addition to statistical techniques to explore and better understand the data. In this paper we build upon our previous work on gameplay analysis and introduce the concept of a play-graph as a way to formally describe and visualize gameplay data. Difference graphs are used to depict the changes between two different datasets i? 1/2 a relevant but currently neglected task in gameplay analytics. Furthermore, we address issues in regard to the visual representation of our former prototype.

803	GameSE_abstract	An Excursion to Software Development Life Cycle Models: An Old to Ever-growing Models	"Software Engineering provides a standard way to develop and maintain a complex software. Industry uses software development Life Cycles (SDLC) to develop a software. SDLC plays an important role as it helps to define the software requirements, model the software component, reduce development and maintenance cost and finally provides manageable software. There exist numerous SDLC models viz.

804	GameSE_abstract	Combined model checking for temporal, probabilistic, and real-time logics	Model checking is a well-established technique for the formal verification of concurrent and distributed systems. In recent years, model checking has been extended and adapted for multi-agent systems, primarily to enable the formal analysis of belief-desire-intention systems. While this has been successful, there is a need for more complex logical frameworks in order to verify realistic multi-agent systems. In particular, probabilistic and real-time aspects, as well as knowledge, belief, goals, etc., are required.However, the development of new model checking tools for complex combinations of logics is both difficult and time consuming. In this article, we show how model checkers for the constituent temporal, probabilistic, and real-time logics can be re-used in a modular way when we consider combined logics involving different dimensions. This avoids the re-implementation of model checking procedures. We define a modular approach, prove its correctness, establish its complexity, and show how it can be used to describe existing combined approaches and define yet-unimplemented combinations. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a case study.

805	GameSE_abstract	DEv-PROMELA: An extension of PROMELA for the modelling, simulation and verification of discrete-event systems	PROMELA is a well-known formalism for the modelling and the verification of concurrent systems. PROMELA deals with high-level specifications. As a result, PROMELA models are expressed in a high-level abstraction which does not consider explicit representation of time or events for example. But, the efficiency of the processes of verification and validation relies on the accuracy of the models. That is why we propose, in this paper, work to develop a new extension of PROMELA for the modelling of discrete-event systems. The verification of these models is then done by combining formal verification and simulation-based verification using SPIN and the tool DEv-PROMELA Studio, or using any existing DEVS simulators.

806	GameSE_abstract	Towards supporting millions of users in modifiable virtual environments by redesigning minecraft-like games as serverless systems	How can Minecraft-like games become scalable cloud services? Hundreds of Minecraft-like games, that is, games acting as modifiable virtual environments (MVEs), are currently played by over 100 million players, but surprisingly they do not scale and are frequently not published as cloud services. We envision a new architecture for large-scale MVEs, supporting much larger numbers of concurrent users by scaling up and out using serverless technology. In our vision, developers focus on the game (business) logic, while cloud providers manage resource management and scheduling (RMS) and guarantee non-functional properties. We provide a definition for MVEs, model their services and deployments, present a vision for large-scale MVEs architected as serverless systems, and suggest concrete steps towards realizing this vision.

807	GameSE_abstract	Hotspot Patterns: The Formal Definition and Automatic Detection of Architecture Smells	In this paper, we propose and empirically validate a suite of hotspot patterns: recurring architecture problems that occur in most complex systems and incur high maintenance costs. In particular, we introduce two novel hotspot patterns, Unstable Interface and Implicit Cross-module Dependency. These patterns are defined based on Baldwin and Clark's design rule theory, and detected by the combination of history and architecture information. Through our tool-supported evaluations, we show that these patterns not only identify the most error-prone and change-prone files, they also pinpoint specific architecture problems that may be the root causes of bug-proneness and change-proneness. Significantly, we show that 1) these structure-history integrated patterns contribute more to error-and change-proneness than other hotspot patterns, and 2) the more hotspot patterns a file is involved in, the more error- and change-prone it is. Finally, we report on an industrial case study to demonstrate the practicality of these hotspot patterns. The architect and developers confirmed that our hotspot detector discovered the majority of the architecture problems causing maintenance pain, and they have started to improve the system's maintainability by refactoring and fixing the identified architecture issues.		o,; ai,; iao,	2015 12TH WORKING IEEE/IFIP CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE (WICSA)	https://doi.org/10.1109/WICSA.2015.12		51-60			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2015	WICSA - Hotspot Patterns: The Formal Definition and Automatic Detection of Architecture Smells	https://doi.org/10.1109/WICSA.2015.12		nan; Keywords; References; Year; Bibtex; Link; Publisher

809	GameSE_abstract	MDD vs. traditional software development: A practitioner's subjective perspective	Context: Today's project managers have a myriad of methods to choose from for the development of software applications. However, they lack empirical data about the character of these methods in terms of usefulness, ease of use or compatibility, all of these being relevant variables to assess the developer's intention to use them.Objective: To compare three methods, each following a different paradigm (Model-Driven, Model-Based and Code-Centric) with respect to their adoption potential by junior software developers engaged in the development of the business layer of a Web 2.0 application.Method: We have conducted a quasi-experiment with 26 graduate students of the University of Alicante. The application developed was a Social Network, which was organized around a fixed set of modules. Three of them, similar in complexity, were used for the experiment. Subjects were asked to use a different method for each module, and then to answer a questionnaire that gathered their perceptions during such use.Results: The results show that the Model-Driven method is regarded as the most useful, although it is also considered the least compatible with previous developers' experiences. They also show that junior software developers feel comfortable with the use of models, and that they are likely to use them if the models are accompanied by a Model-Driven development environment.Conclusions: Despite their relatively low level of compatibility, Model-Driven development methods seem to show a great potential for adoption. That said, however, further experimentation is needed to make it possible to generalize the results to a different population, different methods, other languages and tools, different domains or different application sizes.

810	GameSE_abstract	Efficient, Consistent Distributed Computation with Predictive Treaties	To achieve good performance, modern applications often partition their state across multiple geographically distributed nodes. While this approach reduces latency in the common case, it can be challenging for programmers to use correctly, especially in applications that require strong consistency. We introduce predictive treaties, a mechanism that can significantly reduce distributed coordination without losing strong consistency. The central insight behind our approach is that many computations can be expressed in terms of predicates over distributed state that can be partitioned and enforced locally. Predictive treaties improve on previous work by allowing the locally enforced predicates to depend on time. Intuitively, by predicting the evolution of system state, coordination can be significantly reduced compared to static approaches. We implemented predictive treaties in a distributed system that exposes them in an intuitive programming model. We evaluate performance on several benchmarks, including TPC-C, showing that predictive treaties can significantly increase performance by orders of magnitude and can even outperform customized algorithms.

811	GameSE_abstract	The AtLarge Vision on the Design of Distributed Systems and Ecosystems	High-quality designs of distributed systems and services are essential for our digital economy and society. Threatening to slow down the stream of working designs, we identify the mounting pressure of scale and complexity of (eco-)systems, of ill-defined and wicked problems, and of unclear processes, methods, and tools. We envision design itself as a core research topic in distributed systems, to understand and improve the science and practice of distributed (eco-)system design. Toward this vision, we propose the AtLarge design framework, accompanied by a set of 8 core design principles. We also propose 10 key challenges, which we hope the community can address in the following 5 years. In our experience so far, the proposed framework and principles are practical, and lead to pragmatic and innovative designs for large-scale distributed systems.

812	GameSE_abstract	Avatar movement in World of Warcraft battlegrounds	Evaluating DVE topology management and message propagation schemes requires avatar movement models. Most models are based on reasoned assumptions rather than measured data, potentially biasing evaluation. We measured player movement in World of Warcraft battlegrounds, and compared our observations against common assumptions about player avatar movement and navigation. We found that when modeling a highly interactive DVE such as a battleground, a waypoint model is not sufficient to describe most avatar movement. We were surprised to find that despite game incentives for grouping, the majority of avatar movement between objectives is individual, not grouped. Finally, we found that a hotspot-based model for avatar movement is consistent with our traces.

813	GameSE_abstract	Perceptual view inconsistency: An objective evaluation framework for online game quality of experience (QoE)	The ultimate goal of both game developers and network engineers is to provide a satisfactory quality of experience (QoE) for players. Most past works resort the subjective approaches to assess QoE which have serious limitations. But because of the interdependency of the quality metrics on game playability and the involvement of many players' subjective factors, defining an objective evaluation methodology for QoE faces some challenges. This paper presents an objective evaluation framework for QoE which based on our insights into the causal relationships between network delay, system consistency and QoE. First we breakdown QoE into three basic properties, then we propose to link a player's perception of quality to a novel definition of inconsistency that can then be matched with the three basic properties. Corresponding metrics are created to quantify the inconsistencies. Taking these objective inconsistencies as input, and the subjective QoE properties as output, a mapping function is derived. After aggregating the QoE properties that capture the quality of a single game scenario, we sum the weighted QoE of all the game scenarios to obtain a final overall objective playability evaluation of a game.

815	GameSE_abstract	How developers drive software evolution	As systems evolve their structure change in ways not expected upfront. As time goes by, the knowledge of the developers becomes more and more critical for the process of understanding the system. That is, when we want to understand a certain issue of the system we ask the knowledgeable developers. Yet, in large systems, not every developer is knowledgeable in all the details of the system. Thus, we would want to know which developer is knowledgeable in the issue at hand. In this paper we make use of the mapping between the changes and the author identifiers (e.g., user names) provided by versioning repositories. We first define a measurement for the notion of code ownership. We use this measurement to define the ownership map visualization to understand when and how different developers interacted in which way and in which part of the system. We report the results we obtained on several large systems.

816	GameSE_abstract	Area of simulation: Mechanism and architecture for Multi-Avatar Virtual Environments	Although Multi-Avatar Distributed Virtual Environments (MAVEs) such as Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games entertain daily hundreds of millions of online players, their current designs do not scale. For example, even popular RTS games such as the StarCraft series support in a single game instance only up to 16 players and only a few hundreds of avatars loosely controlled by these players, which is a consequence of the Event-Based Lockstep Simulation (EBLS) scalability mechanism they employ. Through empirical analysis, we show that a single Area of Interest (AoI), which is a scalability mechanism that is sufficient for single-avatar virtual environments (such as Role-Playing Games), also cannot meet the scalability demands of MAVEs. To enable scalable MAVEs, in this work we propose Area of Simulation (AoS), a new scalability mechanism, which combines and extends the mechanisms of AoI and EBLS. Unlike traditional AoI approaches, which employ only update-based operational models, our AoS mechanism uses both event-based and update-based operational models to manage not single, but multiple areas of interest. Unlike EBLS, which is traditionally used to synchronize the entire virtual world, our AoS mechanism synchronizes only selected areas of the virtual world. We further design an AoS-based architecture, which is able to use both our AoS and traditional AoI mechanisms simultaneously, dynamically trading-off consistency guarantees for scalability. We implement and deploy this architecture and we demonstrate that it can operate with an order of magnitude more avatars and a larger virtual world without exceeding the resource capacity of players' computers.

818	GameSE_abstract	Evaluating model-driven development claims with respect to quality: A family of experiments	Context: There is a lack of empirical evidence on the differences between model-driven development (MDD), where code is automatically derived from conceptual models, and traditional software development method, where code is manually written. In our previous work, we compared both methods in a baseline experiment concluding that quality of the software developed following MDD was significantly better only for more complex problems (with more function points). Quality was measured through test cases run on a functional system. Objective: This paper reports six replications of the baseline to study the impact of problem complexity on software quality in the context of MDD. Method: We conducted replications of two types: strict replications and object replications. Strict replications were similar to the baseline, whereas we used more complex experimental objects (problems) in the object replications. Results: MDD yields better quality independently of problem complexity with a moderate effect size. This effect is bigger for problems that are more complex. Conclusions: Thanks to the bigger size of the sample after aggregating replications, we discovered an effect that the baseline had not revealed due to the small sample size. The baseline results hold, which suggests that MDD yields better quality for more complex problems.

819	GameSE_abstract	Massivizing Computer Systems: a Vision to Understand, Design, and Engineer Computer Ecosystems through and beyond Modern Distributed Systems	Our society is digital: industry, science, governance, and individuals depend, often transparently, on the inter-operation of large numbers of distributed computer systems. Although the society takes them almost for granted, these computer ecosystems are not available for all, may not be affordable for long, and raise numerous other research challenges. Inspired by these challenges and by our experience with distributed computer systems, we envision Massivizing Computer Systems, a domain of computer science focusing on understanding, controlling, and evolving successfully such ecosystems. Beyond establishing and growing a body of knowledge about computer ecosystems and their constituent systems, the community in this domain should also aim to educate many about design and engineering for this domain, and all people about its principles. This is a call to the entire community: there is much to discover and achieve.

820	GameSE_abstract	Empirical Investigations of Model Size, Complexity and Effort in a Large Scale, Distributed Model Driven Development Process	Model driven development (MDD) is a software engineering practice that is gaining in popularity. We aim to investigate to what extend it is effective. There is a lack of empirical data to verify the pay-offs of employing MDD tools and techniques. In order to increase the knowledge we have of the impact of MDD in large scale industrial projects, we investigate the project characteristics of a large software development project in which MDD is used in a pure form. This study focuses on analyzing model size and complexity and metrics related to model quality and effort. Furthermore, project team members were asked to elaborate on their views on the impact of using MDD. Our findings include that larger models are more complex, contain more diagrams, are changed more often and worked on longer but do not necessarily contain more defects. However, models that are changed often do contain more defects. Benefits mentioned by team members were an increase in productivity, benefits from a consistent implementation and their perception of improvement of overall quality. Also, a reduction in complexity was attributed to the use of MDD techniques. We could confirm the perceived increase in the quality of the product in that the average amount of defects found is significantly lower than in similar size projects in which MDD was not employed.

821	GameSE_abstract	In search of evidence for model-driven development claims: An experiment on quality, effort, productivity and satisfaction	Context: Model-Driven Development (MDD) is a paradigm that prescribes building conceptual models that abstractly represent the system and generating code from these models through transformation rules. The literature is rife with claims about the benefits of MDD, but they are hardly supported by evidences. Objective: This experimental investigation aims to verify some of the most cited benefits of MDD. Method: We run an experiment on a small set of classes using student subjects to compare the quality, effort, productivity and satisfaction of traditional development and MDD. The experiment participants built two web applications from scratch, one where the developers implement the code by hand and another using an industrial MDD tool that automatically generates the code from a conceptual model. Results: Outcomes show that there are no significant differences between both methods with regard to effort, productivity and satisfaction, although quality in MDD is more robust to small variations in problem complexity. We discuss possible explanations for these results. Conclusions: For small systems and less programming-experienced subjects, MDD does not always yield better results than a traditional method, even regarding effort and productivity. This contradicts some previous statements about MDD advantages. The benefits of developing a system with MDD appear to depend on certain characteristics of the development context.

822	GameSE_abstract	Yardstick: A Benchmark for Minecraft-like Services	Online gaming applications entertain hundreds of millions of daily active players and often feature vastly complex architecture. Among online games, Minecraft-like games simulate unique (e.g., modifiable) environments, are virally popular, and are increasingly provided as a service. However, the performance of Minecraft-like services, and in particular their scalability, is not well understood. Moreover, currently no benchmark exists for Minecraft-like games. Addressing this knowledge gap, in this work we design and use the Yardstick benchmark to analyze the performance of Minecraft-like services. Yardstick is based on an operational model that captures salient characteristics of Minecraft-like services. As input workload, Yardstick captures important features, such as the most-popular maps used within the Minecraft community. Yardstick captures system- and application-level metrics, and derives from them service-level metrics such as frequency of game-updates under scalable workload. We implement Yardstick, and, through real-world experiments in our clusters, we explore the performance and scalability of popular Minecraft-like servers, including the official vanilla server, and the community-developed servers Spigot and Glowstone. Our findings indicate the scalability limits of these servers, that Minecraft-like services are poorly parallelized, and that Glowstone is the least viable option among those tested.	yardstick;  online gaming;  minecraft;  distributed systems;  benchmark;  as a service	van der Sar, Jerom; Donkervliet, Jesse; Iosup, Alexandru	ICPE '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering	https://doi.org/10.1145/3297663.3310307		243-253	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3297663.3310307,

We describe some of the highlights of our survey by presenting a series of industrial projects, and we draw some observations from these surveys and records of experience.

824	GameSE_abstract	Combining generality and practicality in a conit-based continuous consistency model for wide-area replication	Replication is a key approach to scaling wide-area applications. However, the overhead associated with large-scale replication quickly becomes prohibitive across wide-area networks. One effective approach to addressing this limitation is to allow applications to dynamically trade reduced consistency for increased performance and availability. Although extensive study has been performed on relaxed consistency models in traditional replicated databases, none of the models can simultaneously achieve the following two typically conflicting requirements imposed by wide-area applications: generality (capturing application-specific consistency semantics) and practicality (enabling efficient application-independent consistency protocols to be designed and providing natural ways to express application semantics). We propose a conit-based continuous consistency model designed to simultaneously achieve generality and practicality. Our conit theory provides generality, where application-specific consistency requirements are exported as conits. Practicality is achieved by using a simple, spanning set of metrics for conit consistency and by using a per-write weight specification. We demonstrate the generality of our model through representative wide-area applications and by showing that a number of existing models can be expressed as instances of our model. Our efficient, application-independent consistency protocols and prototype implementation verify its practicality.

827	GameSE_abstract	Consistency in Non-Transactional Distributed Storage Systems	"Over the years, different meanings have been associated with the word consistency in the distributed systems community. While in the '80s ""consistency"" typically meant strong consistency, later defined also as linearizability, in recent years, with the advent of highly available and scalable systems, the notion of ""consistency"" has been at the same time both weakened and blurred.In this article, we aim to fill the void in the literature by providing a structured and comprehensive overview of different consistency notions that appeared in distributed systems, and in particular storage systems research, in the last four decades. We overview more than 50 different consistency notions, ranging from linearizability to eventual and weak consistency, defining precisely many of these, in particular where the previous definitions were ambiguous. We further provide a partial order among different consistency predicates, ordering them by their semantic ""strength,"" which we believe will be useful in future research. Finally, we map the consistency semantics to different practical systems and research prototypes.The scope of this article is restricted to non-transactional semantics, that is, those that apply to single storage object operations. As such, our article complements the existing surveys done in the context of transactional, database consistency semantics."

    abstract = ""Over the years, different meanings have been associated with the word consistency in the distributed systems community. While in the '80s ""consistency"" typically meant strong consistency, later defined also as linearizability, in recent years, with the advent of highly available and scalable systems, the notion of ""consistency"" has been at the same time both weakened and blurred.In this article, we aim to fill the void in the literature by providing a structured and comprehensive overview of different consistency notions that appeared in distributed systems, and in particular storage systems research, in the last four decades. We overview more than 50 different consistency notions, ranging from linearizability to eventual and weak consistency, defining precisely many of these, in particular where the previous definitions were ambiguous. We further provide a partial order among different consistency predicates, ordering them by their semantic ""strength,"" which we believe will be useful in future research. Finally, we map the consistency semantics to different practical systems and research prototypes.The scope of this article is restricted to non-transactional semantics, that is, those that apply to single storage object operations. As such, our article complements the existing surveys done in the context of transactional, database consistency semantics."",

828	GameSE_abstract	Human-Computer Interaction - INTERACT 2009	INTERACT 2009 was the 12th of a series of INTERACT international c- ferences supported by the IFIP Technical Committee 13 on Humani? 1/2Computer Interaction. This year,INTERACT washeld in Uppsala (Sweden), organizedby the Swedish Interdisciplinary Interest Group for Humani? 1/2Computer Interaction (STIMDI) in cooperation with the Department of Information Technology at Uppsala University. Like its predecessors, INTERACT 2009 highlighted, both to the academic and to the industrial world, the importance of the humani? 1/2computer interaction (HCI) area and its most recent breakthroughs on current applications. Both - perienced HCI researchers and professionals, as well as newcomers to the HCI ?eld, interested in designing or evaluating interactive software, developing new interaction technologies, or investigating overarching theories of HCI, found in INTERACT 2009 a great forum for communication with people of similar int- ests, to encourage collaboration and to learn. INTERACT 2009 had Research and Practice as its special theme. The r- son we selected this theme is that the research within the ?eld has drifted away from the practicalapplicability of its results and that the HCI practice has come to disregard the knowledge and development within the academic community.	nan	Gross, Tom; Gulliksen, Jan; Kotze, Paula; Oestreicher, Lars; Palanque, Philippe; Prates, Raquel Oliveira; Winckler, Marco	Lecture Notes in Computer Science	https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-03655-2	nan	928	nan		Excluded	snowballing			2	GoogleScholar	2009	Human-Computer Interaction - INTERACT 2009 - Human-Computer Interaction - INTERACT 2009	https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-03655-2	Springer Berlin, Heidelberg

830	GameSE_abstract	Generalized Discrete Events for Accurate Modeling and Simulation of Logic Gates	In this chapter, we present and demonstrate the advantages of the Generalized Discrete EVent system Specification (GDEVS) to build accurate discrete-event models of dynamic systems. These theoretical concepts are applied to the field of logic gate design and analysis in order to get more accurate and fast simulations. States are represented with linear piecewise trajectories contrary to the classical Boolean logic models where states have constant piecewise trajectories (0 and 1). With GDEVS models, the transition from a low level to a high one and vice versa is a linear trajectory and is more realistic than the instantaneous transitions of classical logic gate models. We also demonstrate that this accurate representation does not require any more computations than in Discrete EVent system Specification (DEVS).

831	GameSE_abstract	A quantitative analysis of model-driven code generation through software experimentation	Recent research results have shown that Model-Driven Development (MDD) is a beneficial approach to develop software systems. The reduction of development time enabled by code generation mechanisms is often acknowledged as an important benefit to be further explored. This paper reports on an experiment in which an MDD-based approach using code generation from models is compared with manual coding based on the classic life-cycle. In this experiment, groups of senior students from Computer Science and Computer Engineering undergraduate academic programs implemented a web application using both approaches, and we evaluated in quantitative terms the performance of the groups. The results showed that the development time when code generation was applied was consistently shorter than otherwise. The participants also indicated that they found less difficulties when applying code generation.

832	GameSE_abstract	Understanding, scoping and defining user experience: A survey approach	Despite the growing interest in user experience (UX), it has been hard to gain a common agreement on the nature and scope of UX. In this paper, we report a survey that gathered the views on UX of 275 researchers and practitioners from academia and industry. Most respondents agree that UX is dynamic, context-dependent, and subjective. With respect to the more controversial issues, the authors propose to delineate UX as something individual (instead of social) that emerges from interacting with a product, system, service or an object. The draft ISO definition on UX seems to be in line with the survey findings, although the issues of experiencing anticipated use and the object of UX will require further explication. The outcome of this survey lays ground for understanding, scoping, and defining the concept of user experience.

833	GameSE_abstract	A general and simple method for obtaining R2 from generalized linear mixed-effects models	The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.	coefficient of determination; goodness-of-fit; heritability; information criteria; intra-class correlation; linear models; model fit; repeatability; variance explained	Nakagawa, Shinichi; Schielzeth, Holger	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2041-210x.2012.00261.x		133-142			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2012	A general and simple method for obtaining R2 from generalized linear mixed-effects models	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2041-210x.2012.00261.x	WILEY	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
834	GameSE_abstract	Distribution of effort among software development artefacts: An initial case study	Model-driven development aims at increasing productivity by raising the abstraction level of software specifications and introducing automated transformations for replacing lower level specifications. To assess benefits of replacing a legacy development process with a model-driven approach, one needs to establish a baseline of the current process with respect to the effort invested in the development artefacts. In this paper we report on an initial case study in which we investigate the main artefacts in the analysis and design phase with respect to required effort and perceived importance. We studied a non-model driven development of software based automotive functionality and our initial results show that a few artefacts receive the majority of effort, and that the artefacts that receive the most effort are not the most important ones. The initial results indicate that the distribution of effort between models and other artefacts is similar to that of model-driven projects in spite of the project being perceived and characterized as code-centric.

    abstract = ""Model-driven development aims at increasing productivity by raising the abstraction level of software specifications and introducing automated transformations for replacing lower level specifications. To assess benefits of replacing a legacy development process with a model-driven approach, one needs to establish a baseline of the current process with respect to the effort invested in the development artefacts. In this paper we report on an initial case study in which we investigate the main artefacts in the analysis and design phase with respect to required effort and perceived importance. We studied a non-model driven development of software based automotive functionality and our initial results show that a few artefacts receive the majority of effort, and that the artefacts that receive the most effort are not the most important ones. The initial results indicate that the distribution of effort between models and other artefacts is similar to that of model-driven projects in spite of the project being perceived and characterized as code-centric.

836	GameSE_abstract	DynFilter: Limiting bandwidth of online games using adaptive pub/sub message filtering	Multiplayer online games can generate a lot of server-related outgoing bandwidth, due to many factors such as highly variable amounts of players or the gathering of many players towards the same in-game locations. Predicting the exact amount of required bandwidth to support varying conditions can be costly, and players can experience game-wide failures if bandwidth is insufficiently provisioned. We present DynFilter, a game-oriented message processing middleware designed to adaptively filter state update messages for in-game entities located apart, in order to reduce bandwidth needs and stay within predefined quotas. We ran experiments on Amazon EC2 over a prototype game mimicking a FPS and a MMOG. Our results show that DynFilter is properly able to maintain bandwidth use within the pre-established quotas while still maintaining adequate delivery of relevant state update messages.

837	GameSE_abstract	Dynamic Resource Provisioning in Massively Multiplayer Online Games	Today's Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) can include millions of concurrent players spread across the world and interacting with each other within a single session. Faced with high resource demand variability and with misfit resource renting policies, the current industry practice is to overprovision for each game tens of self-owned data centers, making the market entry affordable only for big companies. Focusing on the reduction of entry and operational costs, we investigate a new dynamic resource provisioning method for MMOG operation using external data centers as low-cost resource providers. First, we identify in the various types of player interaction a source of short-term load variability, which complements the long-term load variability due to the size of the player population. Then, we introduce a combined MMOG processor, network, and memory load model that takes into account both the player interaction type and the population size. Our model is best used for estimating the MMOG resource demand dynamically, and thus, for dynamic resource provisioning based on the game world entity distribution. We evaluate several classes of online predictors for MMOG entity distribution and propose and tune a neural network-based predictor to deliver good accuracy consistently under real-time performance constraints. We assess using trace-based simulation the impact of the data center policies on the quality of resource provisioning. We find that the dynamic resource provisioning can be much more efficient than its static alternative even when the external data centers are busy, and that data centers with policies unsuitable for MMOGs are penalized by our dynamic resource provisioning method. Finally, we present experimental results showing the real-time parallelization and load balancing of a real game prototype using data center resources provisioned using our method and show its advantage against a rudimentary client threshold approach.

838	GameSE_abstract	OneClick: A Framework for Measuring Network Quality of Experience	As the service requirements of network applications shift from high throughput to high media quality, interactivity, and responsiveness, the definition of QoE (Quality of Experience) has become multidimensional. Although it may not be difficult to measure individual dimensions of the QoE, how to capture users' overall perceptions when they are using network applications remains an open question.In this paper, we propose a framework called oneClick to capture users' perceptions when they are using network applications. The framework only requires a subject to click a dedicated key whenever he/she feels dissatisfied with the quality of the application in use. OneClick is particularly effective because it is intuitive, lightweight, efficient, time-aware, and application-independent. We use two objective quality assessment methods, PESQ and VQM, to validate OneClick's ability to evaluate the quality of audio and video clips. To demonstrate the proposed framework's efficiency and effectiveness in assessing user experiences, we implement it on two applications, one for instant messaging applications, and the other for first-person shooter games. A Flash implementation of the proposed framework is also presented.

840	GameSE_abstract	Reachability and Temporal Conflicts in t-Time Petri Nets	Abstract: The first aim of this paper is to characterize marking reachability within scenarios defined on t-time Petri nets. This reachability can be structural (does not depend on the enabling durations), necessary (for all the possible values of the enabling durations within some given enabling intervals) or possible (for some values of the enabling durations). This approach is based on the computation of sojourn times of tokens in places by means of the construction of proof trees in linear logic. The second aim is to illustrate the fact that these sojourn times can also be used to analyze the conflicts between two scenarios, taking into account all the temporal constraints. In some cases, one of the scenarios will invalidate the other one: the temporal constraints are such that this scenario will never occur.

    abstract = ""Abstract: The first aim of this paper is to characterize marking reachability within scenarios defined on t-time Petri nets. This reachability can be structural (does not depend on the enabling durations), necessary (for all the possible values of the enabling durations within some given enabling intervals) or possible (for some values of the enabling durations). This approach is based on the computation of sojourn times of tokens in places by means of the construction of proof trees in linear logic. The second aim is to illustrate the fact that these sojourn times can also be used to analyze the conflicts between two scenarios, taking into account all the temporal constraints. In some cases, one of the scenarios will invalidate the other one: the temporal constraints are such that this scenario will never occur."",

841	GameSE_abstract	Designing gaze gestures for gaming: An investigation of performance	To enable people with motor impairments to use gaze control to play online games and take part in virtual communities, new interaction techniques are needed that overcome the limitations of dwell clicking on icons in the games interface. We have investigated gaze gestures as a means of achieving this. We report the results of an experiment with 24 participants that examined performance differences between different gestures. We were able to predict the effect on performance of the numbers of legs in the gesture and the primary direction of eye movement in a gesture. We also report the outcomes of user trials in which 12 experienced gamers used the gaze gesture interface to play World of Warcraft. All participants were able to move around and engage other characters in fighting episodes successfully. Gestures were good for issuing specific commands such as spell casting, and less good for continuous control of movement compared with other gaze interaction techniques we have developed.

842	GameSE_abstract	Smart composition of game objects using dependency injection	Most game engines are based on inheritance of game objects and/or componentization of behaviors. While this approach enables clear visualization of the system architecture, good code reuse, and fast prototyping, it brings some issues, mostly related to the high dependency between game objects/components instances. This dependency often leads to static casts and null pointer references that are difficult to debug. In this article we propose the use of the dependency injection design pattern to safely initialize game objects and lessen the programmer's role in handling these issues both during the prototyping and production phases. Since these dependencies are attributes of game objects and the injection occurs only at the initialization pass, there is no performance penalty at the game loop.

843	GameSE_abstract	Describing art: An alternative approach to subject access and interpretation	Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the art historical antecedents of providing subject access to images. After reviewing the assumptions and limitations inherent in the most prevalent descriptive method, the paper seeks to introduce a new model that allows for more comprehensive representation of visually-based cultural materials. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a literature-based conceptual analysis, taking Panofsky's theory of iconography and iconology as the starting-point. Panofsky's conceptual model, while appropriate for art created in the Western academic tradition, ignores or misrepresents work from other eras or cultures. Continued dependence on Panofskian descriptive methods limits the functionality and usefulness of image representation systems. Findings: The paper recommends the development of a more precise and inclusive descriptive model for art objects, which is based on the premise that art is not another sort of text, and should not be interpreted as such. Practical implications: The paper provides suggestions for the development of representation models that will enhance the description of non-textual artifacts. Originality/value: The paper addresses issues in information science, the history of art, and computer science, and suggests that a new descriptive model would be of great value to both humanist and social science scholars.

846	GameSE_abstract	Improved Dota2 Lineup Recommendation Model Based on a Bidirectional LSTM	In recent years, e-sports has rapidly developed, and the industry has produced large amounts of data with specifications, and these data are easily to be obtained. Due to the above characteristics, data mining and deep learning methods can be used to guide players and develop appropriate strategies to win games. As one of the world's most famous e-sports events, Dota2 has a large audience base and a good game system. A victory in a game is often associated with a hero's match, and players are often unable to pick the best lineup to compete. To solve this problem, in this paper, we present an improved bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model for Dota2 lineup recommendations. The model uses the Continuous Bag Of Words (CBOW) model in the Word2vec model to generate hero vectors. The CBOW model can predict the context of a word in a sentence. Accordingly, a word is transformed into a hero, a sentence into a lineup, and a word vector into a hero vector, the model applied in this article recommends the last hero according to the first four heroes selected first, thereby solving a series of recommendation problems.

Due to the above characteristics, data mining and deep learning methods can be used to guide players and develop appropriate strategies to win games. As one of the world's most famous e-sports events, Dota2 has a large audience base and a good game system. A victory in a game is often associated with a hero's match, and players are often unable to pick the best lineup to compete. To solve this problem, in this paper, we present an improved bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model for Dota2 lineup recommendations. The model uses the Continuous Bag Of Words (CBOW) model in the Word2vec model to generate hero vectors. The CBOW model can predict the context of a word in a sentence. Accordingly, a word is transformed into a hero, a sentence into a lineup, and a word vector into a hero vector, the model applied in this article recommends the last hero according to the first four heroes selected first, thereby solving a series of recommendation problems.

847	GameSE_abstract	The ingredients of Twitch streaming: Affordances of game streams	During the last five years, game streaming has developed from a niche market into a mainstream activity and the supply of services and technology on offer has exploded. Today, some streamers garner audiences larger than big media houses, and services such as the game streaming service Twitch host millions of daily active users. While such activity is often waived merely as a manifestation of video game culture and an extension of online behaviour by adolescents, the phenomenon has begun to generate significant revenue and has managed to shift media consumption behaviour from large commercial organisations towards content created by private individuals.

To build a better understanding of this, we utilize the existing understanding of affordance theory, and analyse the most popular elements and practices employed by streamers in their video streams and profile pages through the investigation of the 100 most popular individual streamers on the Twitch platform.

848	GameSE_abstract	Determinants of growth and decline in mobile game diffusion	Rapidly advancing mobile technology has made mobile games a leader in the global games market. As the market size of mobile games has grown, the competition has also accelerated enormously. Thus, in order to ensure success, mobile games must sustain their initial boom for a long time, as well as attract enough users to solidify their installed base. The purpose of this research is to detect diffusion patterns and identify the determinants of mobile games' growth and decline hazards. The results show that mobile games have a distinctive brand-level life cycle in which the growth possibility decreases monotonically over time after the release, while the decline possibility rises after reaching the peak and then later begins to fall. This paper shows how the games' characteristics affect their attracting/holding power.

849	GameSE_abstract	On the accuracy of Architecture Compliance Checking support Accuracy of dependency analysis and violation reporting	Architecture Compliance Checking (ACC) is useful to bridge the gap between architecture and implementation. ACC is an approach to verify conformance of implemented program code to high-level models of architectural design. Static ACC focuses on the modular software architecture and on the existence of rule violating dependencies between modules. Accurate tool support is essential for effective and efficient ACC. This paper presents a study on the accuracy of ACC tools regarding dependency analysis and violation reporting. Seven tools were tested and compared by means of a custom-made test application. In addition, the code of open source system Freemind was used to compare the tools on the number and precision of reported violation and dependency messages. On the average, 74 percent of 34 dependency types in our custom-made test software were reported, while 69 percent of 109 violating dependencies within a module of Freemind were reported. The test results show large differences between the tools, but all tools could improve the accuracy of the reported dependencies and violations.

850	GameSE_abstract	Scenario durations characterization of t-timed Petri nets using linear logic	"This paper aims to handle scenario durations of t-timed Petri nets without constructing the class graph. We use a linear logic characterization of scenarios based on the equivalence between reachability in Petri nets and provability of a class of linear logic sequents. It has been shown that it was possible to characterize a scenario with concurrency induced both by the Petri net structure and by the marking. This approach, based on the rewriting of the linear logic sequent proof, is limited because some structural concurrency cannot be expressed. In this paper we develop a new approach based on a canonical proof of the sequent. It does not explicitly characterize the scenario but it delimits its duration through an algebraic symbolic expression. It allows handling non safe or cyclic Petri nets and structures which cannot be uniquely characterized by ""sequence"" and ""parallel"" operations."

The quality cues are examined from two angles: intrinsic and extrinsic.

Based on a publicly available panel data of 142,590 observations for 5415 digital video games, our empirical results suggest that both intrinsic and extrinsic quality cues affect sales of digital video games.

852	GameSE_abstract	Keeping the Game Alive: Evaluating Strategies for the Preservation of Console Video Games	"Interactive fiction and video games are part of our cultural heritage. As original systems cease to work because of hardware and media failures, methods to preserve obsolete video games for future generations have to be developed. The public interest in early video games is high, as exhibitions, regular magazines on the topic and newspaper articles demonstrate. Moreover, games considered to be classic are rereleased for new generations of gaming hardware. However, with the rapid development of new computer systems, the way games look and are played changes constantly. When trying to preserve console video games one faces problems of classified development documentation, legal aspects and extracting the contents from original media like cartridges with special hardware. Furthermore, special controllers and non-digital items are used to extend the gaming experience making it difficult to preserve the look and feel of console video games.

This paper discusses strategies for the digital preservation of console video games. After a short overview of console video game systems, there follows an introduction to digital preservation and related work in common strategies for digital preservation and preserving interactive art. Then different preservation strategies are described with a specific focus on emulation. Finally a case study on console video game preservation is shown which uses the Planets preservation planning approach for evaluating preservation strategies in a documented decision-making process. Experiments are carried out to compare different emulators as well as other approaches, first for a single console video game system, then for different console systems of the same era and finally for systems of all eras. Comparison and discussion of results show that, while emulation works very well in principle for early console video games, various problems exist for the general use as a digital preservation alternative. We show what future work has to be done to tackle these problems."	nan	Guttenbrunner, Mark; Becker, Christoph; Rauber, Andreas	International Journal of Digital Curation	https://doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v5i1.144	nan	nan	nan		Excluded	snowballing			2	GoogleScholar	2010	Keeping the Game Alive: Evaluating Strategies for the Preservation of Console Video Games	https://doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v5i1.144	International Journal of Digital Curation	
853	GameSE_abstract	Loyalty towards online games, gaming addiction, and purchase intention towards online mobile in-game features	The most important stream of game developers' revenue is arguably via gamer's in-game purchases. Previous literature has identified a number of strong determinants of online purchase intention including values, consumer experience, lifestyle, security, perceived risk, information, and subjective norms and behavioural control. The present study examined the relationship between online mobile gaming addiction and loyalty towards purchase intention of online mobile game in-game apps. The present study comprised 430 students from two major Indian universities who completed a short 28-item survey focusing on three variables (i.e., addiction, loyalty towards online games, and purchase intention towards online mobile in-game features). The results demonstrated that (i) online mobile game addiction shared a significant positive relationship with online mobile game loyalty; (ii) online mobile game addiction had a positive relationship with the purchase of online mobile in-game apps, and (iii) online mobile game loyalty increased game users' intention to purchase online mobile in game apps. The present study is the first to investigate loyalty and gaming addiction in relation to the purchase of in-game apps. Game developers will always want to facilitate loyalty among its clientele. However, if the engagement strategies used by gaming operators facilitate addiction as a way of increasing purchase intention of online mobile game in-game apps, this raises serious ethical questions which the gaming industry need to address as part of its corporate social responsibility strategy.

This paper introduces our recent research and user experiments towards interpreting user attention in virtual reality (VR). We designed a gaze-controlled Unity VR game for this study and implemented additional libraries to bridge raw eye-tracking data with game elements and mechanics. The experimental data show distinctive patterns of fixation spans which are paired with user interviews to help us explore characteristics of user attention.	eye tracking;  gaze;  serious games;  user attention;  virtual reality	Dohan, Murtada; Mu, Mu	TVX '19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM International Conference on Interactive Experiences for TV and Online Video	https://doi.org/10.1145/3317697.3325118		167-173	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3317697.3325118,

856	GameSE_abstract	Structure vs. Trajectory Tracking Methods: Soundness Verification of Business Processes	In this paper we contrast the application of two different methods for verifying soundness of workflow. The first approach considers the structure of the workflow net and proposes an analytical process that takes into account the incidence matrix and a strict positive vector to prove soundness. The second method is based on decision process Petri nets theory showing that the problem of finding an optimum trajectory for validation of well-formed workflow is solvable. The advantage of both solutions is that to tackle the soundness verification problem use the Lyapunov stability theory which corresponds to an analytical method for Petri nets. We validate our statement theoretically and by an application example.

857	GameSE_abstract	Game Data Mining: Clustering and Visualization of Online Game Data in Cyber-Physical Worlds	Since its debut in May 2016, Overwatch has quickly become a popular team-based online video game. Despite the popularity of Overwatch, many new players-who join the game unsure how to compete with the game's veterans-feel overwhelmed with the vast knowledge required to properly play at higher skill levels. In this paper, a data mining algorithm is designed and developed for clustering and visualization of online game data at the cyber-physical world boundary. Scientifically, the algorithm uses affinity propagation for clustering and two-dimensional graphs for visualizing online game data. The algorithm analyzes the Overwatch game data for the discovery of new knowledge about current players and the clustering of data for each hero character. This knowledge enables the analysis of individual clusters and provides statistics that have a high correlation with winning player strategies. These statistics are expected to have a large influence on how a character is played, and thus can aid new players in learning their priorities as each hero character. In other words, the algorithm helps analyze the online game playing data, get insight about the grouping or clusters of players, and offer suggestions to new players of the game.

858	GameSE_abstract	Engaging voluntary contributions in online communities: A hidden markov model	User contribution is critical to online communities but also difficult to sustain given its public goods nature. This paper studies the design of IT artifacts to motivate voluntary contributions in online communities. We propose a dynamic approach, which allows the effect of motivating mechanisms to change across users over time. We characterize the dynamics of user contributions using a hidden Markov model (HMM) with latent motivation states under the public goods framework. We focus on three motivating mechanisms on transitioning users between the latent states: reciprocity, peer recognition, and self-image. Based on Bayesian estimation of the model with user-level panel data, we identify three motivation states (low, medium, and high), and show that the motivating mechanisms, implemented through various IT artifacts, could work differently across states. Specifically, reciprocity is only effective to transition users from low to medium motivation state, whereas peer recognition can boost all users to higher states. And self-image shows no effect when a user is already in high motivation state, although it helps users in low and medium states move to the high state. Design simulations on our structural model provide additional insights into the consequences of changing specific IT artifacts. These findings offer implications for platform designers on how to motivate user contributions and build sustainable online communities.

861	GameSE_abstract	Onward Through the Fog: Computer Game Collection and the Play of Obsolescence	"In Mardi and a Voyage Thither, novelist Herman Melville writes of the peculiar and startling confluence of memory, objects, valuation, and disfigurement that mark the collector of obsoletia. The storyi? 1/2s antiquary is the picture of perverse depletion, with a body i? 1/2crooked, and dwarfed, and surmounted by a hump, that sat on his back like a burdeni? 1/2 (328), his hut in shambles, and i? 1/2the precious antiques, and curios, and obsoletesi? 1/2i? 1/2the objects of his collectioni? 1/2i? 1/2strewn about, all dusty and disorderedi? 1/2 (329). This unkempt display cum impromptu museum turns out to present a mere fraction of the curatori? 1/2s collection, the rest of which is host to countless subtle molds and ravenous worms in a vast catacomb below ground. Traversing this darkened vault, one visitor says, is i? 1/2like going down to posterityi? 1/2 (332).

As inveterate accumulators ourselves, we can certainly relate to Mardii? 1/2s ""extraordinary antiquarian"": pursuing obsolete things has transformed us too (though hopefully not quite so hideously), as well as the work we do and the spaces we do it in. Since 1999, we have been collectingi? 1/2and subsequently lending out to scholars the world overi? 1/2computer games, systems, and game-related paraphernalia. By recent estimates, our Learning Games Initiative Archive contains more than 20,000 artifacts, from Venezuelan Pong clones to Mario-themed lollipops. Archival work at this scale and with this diversity is not easy, and it constantly butts up against a host of intractable questions. For example, what does it mean to isolate a thing that no longer has its original value but has taken on a new one? When researchers hold such transmuted artifacts up for inspection, what are they looking for and how might archivists help them to find it? Is the primary work of computer game archivists (and indeed archivists of all types) to protect artifacts from the elements, to enjoin them upon their kin, and to guard over the collection for the sake of some abstract posterity, or is it something more collaborative and communal? Finally, is it possible for research-oriented collectors to engage the process of collection without suffering the deformations of skin and soul (not to mention pocketbook) that often plague the more solipsistic acquirer?

We offer this article as an entri? 1/2e to these questions, as a way to begin to attend to some of the theoretical and practical complexities of obsolescence and its negotiation. We do so primarily by focusing on where those complexities intersect with computer games, the new media we collect and study."	obsolete; obsoletia; obsolescence; computer games; play	Thompson, Jason; McAllister, Ken S.; Ruggill, Judd Ethan	M/C Journal	https://doi.org/10.5204/mcj.155	nan	nan	nan		Excluded	snowballing			2	GoogleScholar	2009	Onward Through the Fog: Computer Game Collection and the Play of Obsolescence	https://doi.org/10.5204/mcj.155	M/C Journal	
862	GameSE_abstract	User Acceptance of Agile Information Systems: A Model and Empirical Test	In response to the rapid changes in users' requirements, a new generation of information systems (IS), namely, agile IS, has emerged. Agile IS, defined as information systems developed using agile methods, are characterized by frequent upgrades with a small number of new features released periodically. The existing research on agile IS has mainly focused on the developers' perspective with little research into end users' responses to these agile IS. Drawing upon the tripartite model of attitude, the status quo and the omission bias theories, and the availability heuristic, we propose a model that utilizes constructs from the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, the IS continuance model, habit, and individual differences to examine the drivers of user acceptance of agile IS. Further, we investigate not only users' intentions to continue using the agile IS but also their intentions to use new features when they are released, which is a surrogate for the ultimate success of agile IS. Data from 477 users of an agile IS showed that users' level of comfort with constant changes, the facilitating conditions provided, and users' habit are predictors of both types of intentions, with users' level of comfort with constant changes being the strongest predictor. Users' intentions to continue using agile IS are also determined by users' satisfaction with and perceived usefulness of the past upgrades. Finally, users who are innovative are more likely to use future releases of new features. The present work fills a gap in the software engineering literature and contributes a technology acceptance model specific to agile IS, which are becoming a mainstay of companies' IT portfolio in a fast-changing business environment.	agile methods; agile systems; availability heuristic; comfort with change; habit; information systems continuance; omission bias; personal innovativeness; status quo bias; unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT)	Hong, Weiyin; Thong, James Y.

863	GameSE_abstract	Heuristics for discovering architectural violations	Software architecture conformance is a key software quality control activity that aims to reveal the progressive gap normally observed between concrete and planned software architectures. In this paper, we present ArchLint, a lightweight approach for architecture conformance based on a combination of static and historical source code analysis. For this purpose, ArchLint relies on four heuristics for detecting both absences and divergences in source code based architectures. We applied ArchLint in an industrial-strength system and as a result we detected 119 architectural violations, with an overall precision of 46.7% and a recall of 96.2%, for divergences. We also evaluated ArchLint with four open-source systems, used in an independent study on reflexion models. In this second study, ArchLint achieved precision results ranging from 57.1% to 89.4%.

865	GameSE_abstract	Recommending Refactorings to Reverse Software Architecture Erosion	Architectural erosion is a recurrent problem faced by software architects. Despite this fact, the process is usually tackled in ad hoc way, without adequate tool support at the architecture level. To address this issue, we describe the preliminary design of a recommendation system whose main purpose is to provide refactoring guidelines for developers and maintainers during the task of reversing an architectural erosion process. The paper formally describes first recommendations proposed in our current research and results of their application in a web-based application.

867	GameSE_abstract	Stop the software architecture erosion:building better software systems	In lots of software projects unfortunately an architectural erosion happens over time. Modules which were independent, become connected, plug-ins finally depend on each other, and in general the architecture gets violated more and more. In this paper we will discuss how to avoid such architecture- and design-erosion and how an already eroded system can be fixed again. We will look at three different level of static analysis and examine architectural analysis in detail. Also typical use cases for architectural analysis are examined, followed by a collection of requirements for powerful tool support. The eclipse platform serves as case study and we look if, and how far architectural erosion happened there and if it can be fixed. Finally we discuss pros and cons of architectural analysis and conclude with an out view.	architecture; design; erosion; refactoring; simulation; software; static code analysis	Bernhard Merkle	OOPSLA '10: Proceedings of the ACM international conference companion on Object oriented programming systems languages and applications companion	https://doi.org/10.1145/1869542.1869563		129-138			Excluded	snowballing			2	ACM	2010	SPLASH/OOPSLA Companion - Stop the software architecture erosion: building better software systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/1869542.1869563	Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
868	GameSE_abstract	The role of software updates in information systems continuance - An experimental study from a user perspective	Although software updates are a ubiquitous phenomenon in professional and private IT usage, they have to date received little attention in the IS post-adoption literature. Drawing on expectation-confirmation theory and the IS continuance literature, we investigate whether, when and how software updates affect users' continuance intentions (CI). Based on a controlled laboratory experiment, we find a positive effect of feature updates on users' CI. According to this effect, software vendors can increase their users' CI by delivering features through updates after a software has been released and is already used by customers. We also find that users prefer frequent feature updates over less frequent update packages that bundle several features in one update. However, the positive effect from updates occurs only with functional feature updates and not with technical non-feature updates, disclosing update frequency and update type as crucial moderators to this effect. Furthermore, we unveil that this beneficial effect of feature updates operates through positive disconfirmation of expectations, resulting in increased perceived usefulness and satisfaction. Implications for research and practice as well as directions for future research are discussed. We investigate the effect of software updates on users' continuance intentions.We find a positive effect of feature updates on users' continuance intentions.Update frequency and update type are crucial moderators to this effect.This effect operates through positive disconfirmation of expectations.

869	GameSE_abstract	Look to the future: Enhancing online gamer loyalty from the perspective of the theory of consumption values	Most online games are commercial systems that attempt to motivate garners to continue playing by enticing them to progress from one game level to the next. This indicates that the expectancy for character growth (i.e., the anticipation of an increase in game level) may enhance loyalty. However, no research has yet examined the antecedents of expectancy for character growth. Hence, this study adopts the theory of consumption values to examine the relationship among consumption values, expectancy for character growth, and online gamer loyalty. Responses from 1440 online garners were analyzed using the structural equation modeling method. Learning, novelty, enjoyment, and social value were positively related to expectancy for character growth, and thus loyalty. This study is the first examining the relation among consumption values, expectancy for character growth, and online gamer loyalty. It contributes novel insights enabling electronic commerce managers to make more targeted decisions on resource allocation to effectively enhance garners' expectations and loyalty, thus creating promising revenues and competitive advantage.

871	GameSE_abstract	On the Application of Inequality Indices in Comparative Software Analysis	Socio-economic inequality indices, like the Gini coefficient or the Theil index, offer us a viable alternative to central tendency statistics when being used to aggregate software metrics data. The specific value of these inequality indices lies in their ability to capture changes in the distribution of metrics data more effectively than, say, average or median. Knowing whether the distribution of one metrics is more unequal than that of another one or whether its distribution becomes more or less unequal over time is the crucial element here. There are, however, challenges in the application of these indices that can result in ecological fallacies. The first issue relates to occurrences of zeros in metrics data, and not all inequality indices cope well with this event. The second problem arises from applying a macro-level inference to a micro-level analysis of a changing population. The Gini coefficient works for the former, whereas the decomposable Theil index serves the latter. Nevertheless, when used with care, and usually in combination, both indices can provide us with a powerful tool not only to analyze software, but also to assess its organizational health and maintainability over time.

872	GameSE_abstract	Twisty Little Passages Almost All Alike: Applying the FRBR Model to a Classic Computer Game.	Humanities scholars and librarians both confront questions regarding the boundaries of texts and the relationships between various editions, translations and adaptations. The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) Final Report from the International Federation of Library Associations has provided the library community with a model for addressing these questions in the bibliographic systems they create. The Preserving Virtual Worlds project has been investigating FRBR's potential as a model for the description of computer games and interactive fiction. While FRBR provides an attractive theoretical model, the complexity of computer games as works makes its application to such software creations problematic in practice.	nan	McDonough, Jerome P.; Kirschenbaum, Matthew G.; Reside, Doug; Fraistat, Neil; Jerz, Dennis	Digital Humanities Quaterly	https://www.proquest.com/docview/2555208458?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&sourcetype=Scholarly%20Journals	nan	nan	nan		Excluded	snowballing			2	GoogleScholar	2010	Twisty Little Passages Almost All Alike: Applying the FRBR Model to a Classic Computer Game.	https://www.proquest.com/docview/2555208458?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&sourcetype=Scholarly%20Journals	Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations	
873	GameSE_abstract	Dynamic difficulty adjustment on MOBA games	This paper addresses the dynamic difficulty adjustment on MOBA games as a way to improve the players entertainment. Although MOBA is currently one of the most played genres around the world, it is known as a game that offer less autonomy, more challenges and consequently more frustration. Due to these characteristics, the use of a mechanism that performs the difficulty balance dynamically seems to be an interesting alternative to minimize and/or avoid that players experience such frustrations. In this sense, this paper presents a dynamic difficulty adjustment mechanism for MOBA games. The main idea is to create a computer controlled opponent that adapts dynamically to the player performance, trying to offer to the player a better game experience. This is done by evaluating the performance of the player using a metric based on some game features and switching the difficulty of the opponent's artificial intelligence behavior accordingly. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were performed and the results showed that the system is capable of adapting dynamically to the opponent's skills. In spite of that, the qualitative experiments with users showed that the player's expertise has a greater influence on the perception of the difficulty level and dynamic adaptation.		ilva, M; ilva, V; haimowicz,	ENTERTAINMENT COMPUTING	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.entcom.2016.10.002		103-123			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2017	Dynamic difficulty adjustment on MOBA games	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.entcom.2016.10.002	ELSEVIER SCI LTD	nan; Keywords; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
874	GameSE_abstract	Boosting: Rank and skill deception in esports	"Competitive video gaming, collectively known as esports, has surged in popularity over the last decade. The rapid growth in revenue, viewership, players and exposure to date has led to the rise of impropriety in the form of cheating. ""Boosting"" is a form of cheating whereby high-skilled players access lower-skilled players' accounts for the purpose of increasing the rank of the account for monetary gain. From esports games such as League of Legends to Overwatch, players are universally ranked based on performance and results-based metrics. The perceived social status of these ranks, along with rank-associated rewards such as in-game cosmetics, ability to enter tournaments and join prestigious teams are significant motivators for one to cheat. This paper reviews and discusses the notable issue of boosting, estimates prevalence and profitability of boosting, its impact on the esports industry and community, and how it is currently being addressed."

875	GameSE_abstract	Gaze interaction with virtual on-line communities: levelling the playing field for disabled users	This paper introduces the concept of enabling gaze-based interaction for users with high-level motor disabilities to control an avatar in a first-person perspective on-line community. An example community, Second Life, is introduced that could offer disabled users the same virtual freedom as any other user, and so allow disabled users to be able-bodied (should they wish) within the virtual world. A survey of the control demands for Second Life and a subsequent preliminary experiment show that gaze control has inherent problems particularly for locomotion and camera movement. These problems result in a lack of effective gaze control of Second Life, such that control is not practical and show that disabled users who interact using gaze will have difficulties in controlling Second Life (and similar environments). This suggests that these users could once again become disabled in the virtual world by the difficulties in effectively controlling their avatars, and their 'disability privacy', or the right to control an avatar as effectively as an able bodied user, and so appear virtually able bodied, will be compromised. Methods for overcoming these difficulties such as the use of gaze aware on-screen assistive tools could overcome these problems, but games manufacturers must design inclusively, so that disabled users may have the right to disability privacy in their Second (virtual) Lives.		ates,; ickers,; stance, H	UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10209-009-0173-0		261-272			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2009	Gaze interaction with virtual on-line communities: levelling the playing field for disabled users	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10209-009-0173-0	SPRINGER HEIDELBERGTIERGARTENSTRASSE	nan; Keywords; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
876	GameSE_abstract	Impact of avatar identification on online gamer loyalty: Perspectives of social identity and social capital theories	Online games have created significant opportunities for electronic commerce managers. The degree to which online gamers regard their avatars-their gaming representations-as themselves is known to be influential to gamers' behavior but little is known about how such identification impacts online gamer loyalty (i.e., gamers' continued intention to play). This study filled this gap by developing its research framework from the perspective of the social identity theory and the social capital theory. Responses from 1384 online gamers were collected, and structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. The analytical results indicate that avatar identification (the degree to which users regard avatars as themselves) is positively related to participation in gaming communities and social presence (the degree of awareness of other persons and interpersonal relationships). These were further positively related to online gamer loyalty. This study is the first using the two theories, i.e., the social identity and social capital theoretical perspectives, to clarify the mechanism underlying the impact of avatar identification on online gamer loyalty, assisting electronic commerce managers to create a loyal user base.

877	GameSE_abstract	"Using Virtual Environments to Tell the Story: ""The Battle of Thermopylae"""	Virtual environments have been valued as being extremely motivating for learners and therefore are employed as an innovative, more accessible framework to deliver education and entertainment to the public. Recent advances in creating videogame applications imbedded with effective learning principles, along with the evolution of human computer interfaces performed within the entertainment industry, suggests that a combination of successful practices in these areas could potentially transform virtual environments to a significant educational tool that could facilitate the learning process. This paper describes a virtual reality exhibit implemented for the museum of Thermopylae located at the site of the original battle, near the city of Lamia in Greece. We utilized storytelling techniques and principles of modern videogames to disseminate historical knowledge about the battle and the associated legends. After describing the hardware and software components comprising this installation we elaborate over the educational techniques designed to reinforce the strength of virtual reality technology as a mean of designing educational experiences in the context of historical events.

879	GameSE_abstract	Enabled Players: The Value of Accessible Digital Games	It is increasingly recognized that there are many players of mainstream digital games who have some form of disability. It is not known which aspects of games are valued by players, regardless of whether they have a disability. We report on a survey of 71 players from the general game community and 123 players with disabilities asking what makes games important to them. We found established motivations to play such as social connection and escapism but additionally that players find games beneficial and provide artistic experiences. Players with disabilities explicitly referred to games helping them to feel enabled or being on a level footing with nondisabled players. The value of accessible games is not just mere play but playing the same games as everyone else. This implies that achieving accessibility through adapting games is an important approach to provide the valued connection and enablement that games provide.	players with disabilities; digital games; accessible games; player experience	Cairns, Paul; Power, Christopher; Barlet, Mark; Haynes, Gregory; Kaufman, Craig; Beeston, Jen	GAMES AND CULTURE	https://doi.org/10.1177/1555412019893877		262-282			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2019	Enabled Players: The Value of Accessible Digital Games:	https://doi.org/10.1177/1555412019893877	SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

881	GameSE_abstract	Toward Visualization for Games: Theory, Design Space, and Patterns	Electronic games are starting to incorporate in-game telemetry that collects data about player, team, and community performance on a massive scale, and as data begins to accumulate, so does the demand for effectively analyzing this data. In this paper, we use examples from both old and new games of different genres to explore the theory and design space of visualization for games. Drawing on these examples, we define a design space for this novel research topic and use it to formulate design patterns for how to best apply visualization technology to games. We then discuss the implications that this new framework will potentially have on the design and development of game and visualization technology in the future.

882	GameSE_abstract	Video game training enhances cognitive control in older adults	Cognitive control is defined by a set of neural processes that allow us to interact with our complex environment in a goal-directed manner. Humans regularly challenge these control processes when attempting to simultaneously accomplish multiple goals (multitasking), generating interference as the result of fundamental information processing limitations. It is clear that multitasking behaviour has become ubiquitous in today's technologically dense world, and substantial evidence has accrued regarding multitasking difficulties and cognitive control deficits in our ageing population. Here we show that multitasking performance, as assessed with a custom-designed three-dimensional video game (NeuroRacer), exhibits a linear age-related decline from 20 to 79 years of age. By playing an adaptive version of NeuroRacer in multitasking training mode, older adults (60 to 85 years old) reduced multitasking costs compared to both an active control group and a no-contact control group, attaining levels beyond those achieved by untrained 20-year-old participants, with gains persisting for 6 months. Furthermore, age-related deficits in neural signatures of cognitive control, as measured with electroencephalography, were remediated by multitasking training (enhanced midline frontal theta power and frontal-posterior theta coherence). Critically, this training resulted in performance benefits that extended to untrained cognitive control abilities (enhanced sustained attention and working memory), with an increase in midline frontal theta power predicting the training-induced boost in sustained attention and preservation of multitasking improvement 6 months later. These findings highlight the robust plasticity of the prefrontal cognitive control system in the ageing brain, and provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, of how a custom-designed video game can be used to assess cognitive abilities across the lifespan, evaluate underlying neural mechanisms, and serve as a powerful tool for cognitive enhancement.

884	GameSE_abstract	Developing Digital Games through Software Reuse	"Gaming is an old humansi? 1/2 habit. Games help in logical development and encourage learning of theoretical and practical concepts. Besides they offer entertainment
and challenge. The advent of the personal computer changed this tradition. Every year new challenges arise in a digital format, which lead the young and adults to spend hours
in front of a computer or TV screen in an attempt to overcome hurdles and reach an objective. Quality, sophistication, and constant innovation are attained through complex
computer software that almost has an obligation to improve as each new title is released, due to this game development becomes a challenge. Considering that a game title is
software and thus faces the same restrictions of business applications, this article intends to analyze, under the optics of reuse, if game development resorts to reuse, and where and how this happens."

885	GameSE_abstract	AN INTELLIGENT DECISION SUPPORT BASED ON A SUBTRACTIVE CLUSTERING AND FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM FOR MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM IN SERIOUS GAME	Learning decision making through playing a game is an interesting activity for the decision maker or player. In this paper, a multiobjective optimization problem for economic and emission dispatch in which the player can learn about the tradeoff between fuel cost (economic) and emission problems to achieve optimal decisions is considered. A non-player character (NPC) is an entity that is built to provide intelligent decision support for the player. The proposed approach is carried out in two stages for the NPC module: the first stage uses the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II method to solve the multiobjective optimization problem; this stage produces some optimal solutions. The next stage uses subtractive clustering to cluster optimal solutions; furthermore, these clusters are used to build a fuzzy inference system based on the Mamdani type. In this stage, players can select the best decision offered by the NPC.	Multiobjective; optimization; nonplayer character; subtractive clustering; fuzzy inference system	Buditjahjanto, I. G. P.

886	GameSE_abstract	FILTWAM - A Framework for Online Affective Computing in Serious Games	This paper introduces a Framework for Improving Learning Through Webcams And Microphones (FILTWAM). It proposes an overarching framework comprising conceptual and technical frameworks for enhancing the online communication skills of lifelong learners. Our approach interprets the emotional state of people using webcams and microphones and combines relevant and timely feedback based upon learner's facial expressions and verbalizations (like sadness, anger, disgust, fear, happiness, surprise, and neutral). The feedback generated from the webcams is expected to enhance learner's awareness of their own behavior. Our research enhances flexibility and scalability in contrast with face-to-face trainings and better helps the interests of lifelong learners who prefer to study at their own pace, place and time. Our small-scale proof of concept study exemplifies the practical application of FILTWAM and provides first evaluation results on that. This study will guide future development of software, training materials, and research. It will validate the use of webcam data for a real-time and adequate interpretation of facial expressions into emotional states.

887	GameSE_abstract	Collaborative use of mobile augmented reality with paper maps	The popularity of augmented reality (AR) applications on mobile devices is increasing, but there is as yet little research on their use in real-settings. We review data from two pioneering field trials where MapLens, a magic lens that augments paper-based city maps, was used in small-group collaborative tasks. The first study compared MapLens to a digital version akin to Google Maps, the second looked at using one shared mobile device vs. using multiple devices. The studies find place-making and use of artefacts to communicate and establish common ground as predominant modes of interaction in AR-mediated collaboration with users working on tasks together despite not needing to.

889	GameSE_abstract	Modularity for Next Gen Games Designers	Games require more visuals as virtual worlds become larger and gamers' expectations soar. Unreal Engine(tm) (version 4, or UE4) technology was used to demonstrate the merging of visual scripting, textures and materials to create a solution that satisfies modern graphics creation. The product demonstrated in this paper is a modular planet system complete with Blueprint, which enables designers and artists to develop fully customisable worlds. The method shows the utilisation of linear interpolation, material parameters, panners, material parameters collection, and Blueprint to provide a real time in-game solution.

890	GameSE_abstract	Influences of perceived product innovation upon usage behavior for MMORPG: Product capability, technology capability, and user centered design	Recent advances in online game technology have set the pace for tremendous growth in the development of new entertainment applications. The authors study relationships among product capability, technology capability, perceived product innovation, user-centered design, attitude, and intention to play online games. They find that product capability, technology capability, and user-centered design influence perceived product innovation. Gamers want to interact with functional products designed with a deep understanding of customer needs. Moreover, user-centered design influences perceived product innovation, attitude toward playing, and behavioral intention to play. The study includes the user-centered design variable to reflect a unique characteristic of online games.

891	GameSE_abstract	Play's the Thing: A Framework to Study Videogames as Performance	Performance studies deals with human action in context, as well as the process of making meaning between the performers and the audience. This paper presents a framework to study videogames as a performative medium, applying terms from performance studies to videogames both as software and as games. This performance framework for videogames allows us to understand how videogames relate to other performance activities, as well as understand how they are a structured experience that can be designed. Theatrical performance is the basis of the framework, because it is the activity that has the most in common with games. Rather than explaining games in terms of 'interactive drama,' the parallels with theatre help us understand the role of players both as performers and as audience, as well as how the game design shapes the experience. The theatrical model also accounts for how videogames can have a spectatorship, and how the audience may have an effect on gameplay.

This paper presents a framework to study videogames as a performative medium, applying terms from performance studies to videogames both as software and as games. This performance framework for videogames allows us to understand how videogames relate to other performance activities, as well as understand how they are a structured experience that can be designed. Theatrical performance is the basis of the framework, because it is the activity that has the most in common with games. Rather than explaining games in terms of 'interactive drama,' the parallels with theatre help us understand the role of players both as performers and as audience, as well as how the game design shapes the experience. The theatrical model also accounts for how videogames can have a spectatorship, and how the audience may have an effect on gameplay. (c) 2009 Authors \& Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA)."",

892	GameSE_abstract	A New Villain: Investigating Steganography in Source Engine Based Video Games	In an ever expanding field such as computer and digital forensics, new threats to data privacy and legality are presented daily. As such, new methods for hiding and securing data need to be created. Using steganography to hide data within video game files presents a solution to this problem. In response to this new method of data obfuscation, investigators need methods to recover specific data as it may be used to perform illegal activities. This paper demonstrates the widespread impact of this activity and shows how this problem is present in the real world. Our research also details methods to perform both of these tasks: hiding and recovery data from video game files that utilize the Source gaming engine.

893	GameSE_abstract	Creating wheelchair-controlled video games: Challenges and opportunities when involving young people with mobility impairments and game design experts	Although participatory design (PD) is currently the most acceptable and respectful process we have for designing technology, recent discussions suggest that there may be two barriers to the successful application of PD to the design of digital games: First, the involvement of audiences with special needs can introduce new practical and ethical challenges to the design process. Second, the use of non-experts in game design roles has been criticised in that participants lack skills necessary to create games of appropriate quality. To explore how domain knowledge and user involvement influence game design, we present results from two projects that addressed the creation of movement-based wheelchair-controlled video games from different perspectives. The first project was carried out together with a local school that provides education for young people with special needs, where we invited students who use wheelchairs to take part in design sessions. The second project involved university students on a game development course, who do not use wheelchairs, taking on the role of expert designers. They were asked to design concepts for wheelchair-controlled games as part of a final-year course on game design. Our results show that concepts developed by both groups were generally suitable examples of wheelchair-controlled motion-based video games, but we observed differences regarding level of detail of game concepts, and ideas of disability. Additionally, our results show that the design exercise exposed vulnerabilities in both groups, outlining that the risk of practical and emotional vulnerability needs to be considered when working with the target audience as well as expert designers.

894	GameSE_abstract	Exploring perceived quality in software organizations	Software projects have four main objectives; produce required functionalities, with acceptable quality, in budget and in schedule. Usually these objectives are implemented by setting requirements for the software projects, and working towards achieving these requirements as well as possible. So how is the intended quality handled in this process of pursuing project goals? The objective of this study is to explore how organizations understand software quality and identify factors which seem to affect the quality outcome of the development process. The study applies two research approaches; a survey with 31 organizations and in-depth interviews with 36 software professional from 12 organizations for identifying concepts that affect quality. The study confirms that the quality in software organization is a complex, interconnected entity, and the definitions of desired and perceived quality fluctuate between different process stakeholders. Overall, in many cases the software organizations have identified the desired quality, but are not communicating it properly.

895	GameSE_abstract	Compiler-Assisted Source-to-Source Skeletonization of Application Models for System Simulation	Performance modeling of networks through simulation requires application endpoint models that inject traffic into the simulation models. Endpoint models today for system-scale studies consist mainly of post-mortem trace replay, but these off-line simulations may lack flexibility and scalability. On-line simulations running so-called skeleton applications run reduced versions of an application that generate traffic that is the same or similar to the full application. These skeleton apps have advantages for flexibility and scalability, but they often must be custom written for the simulator itself. Auto-skeletonization of existing application source code via compiler tools would provide endpoint models with minimal development effort. These source-to-source transformations have been only narrowly explored. We introduce a pragma language and corresponding Clang-driven source-to-source compiler that performs auto-skeletonization based on provided pragma annotations. We describe the compiler toolchain, validate the generated skeletons, and show scalability of the generated simulation models beyond 100K endpoints for example MPI applications. Overall, we assert that our proposed auto-skeletonization approach and the flexible skeletons it produces can be an important tool in realizing balanced exascale interconnect designs.		ilke, J; enny, J; umley,	HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING, ISC HIGH PERFORMANCE 2018	https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-92040-5_7		123-143			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2018	Compiler-Assisted Source-to-Source Skeletonization of Application Models for System Simulation	https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-92040-5_7	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLINHEIDELBERGER PLATZ	nan; Keywords; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
896	GameSE_abstract	Work for Play: Careers in Video Game Development	Video games are not only for play; they also provide work. Making video games is a serious--and big--business. Creating these games is complex and requires the collaboration of many developers, who perform a variety of tasks, from production to programming. They work for both small and large game studios to create games that can be played on many different devices, including console systems, computers, and cell phones. This article covers career options in video game development. The first section provides an overview of the development process. The second section describes four groups of video game occupations: designers, programmers, artists, and others. The third section covers the skills and training workers need for these jobs. The fourth section discusses the benefits and challenges of working in the video game industry. And the fifth section provides job-seeking tips for a career in video game development.

897	GameSE_abstract	Astrojumper: Motivating Exercise with an Immersive Virtual Reality Exergame	We present the design and evaluation of Astrojumper, an immersive virtual reality exergame developed to motivate players to engage in rigorous, full-body exercise. We performed a user study with 30 people between the ages of 6 and 50 who played the game for 15 min. Regardless of differences in age, gender, activity level, and video game experience, participants rated Astrojumper extremely positively and experienced a significant increase in heart rate after gameplay. Additionally, we found that participants' ratings of perceived workout intensity positively correlated with their level of motivation. Overall, our results demonstrate that Astrojumper effectively motivates both children and adults to exercise through immersive virtual reality technology and a simple, yet engaging, game design.		inkelstein,; ickel,; uma, E	PRESENCE-TELEOPERATORS AND VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS	https://doi.org/10.1162/pres_a_00036		78-92			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2011	Astrojumper: Motivating exercise with an immersive virtual reality exergame	https://doi.org/10.1162/pres_a_00036	MIT PRESSONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA	nan; Keywords; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
898	GameSE_abstract	Value Creation in the Video Game Industry: Industry Economics, Consumer Benefits, and Research Opportunities	In the past twenty years, the video game industry has established itself as a significant contributor to the global entertainment economy. Compared to more established entertainment industries such as movies and music, limited scholarly research in marketing has addressed the processes that create value for companies and consumers in the context of video games which are now available on multiple devices (e.g., consoles, portables, mobile devices) and through multiple channels (e.g., retail and online). The authors therefore develop a conceptual framework of value creation through video games, highlight important findings from extant research in marketing and other disciplines, and apply the framework to derive future research opportunities.

899	GameSE_abstract	A methodology to assess the impact of design patterns on software quality	"Context: Software quality is considered to be one of the most important concerns of software production teams. Additionally, design patterns are documented solutions to common design problems that are expected to enhance software quality. Until now, the results on the effect of design patterns on software quality are controversial.Aims: This study aims to propose a methodology for comparing design patterns to alternative designs with an analytical method. Additionally, the study illustrates the methodology by comparing three design patterns with two alternative solutions, with respect to several quality attributes.Method: The paper introduces a theoretical/analytical methodology to compare sets of ""canonical"" solutions to design problems. The study is theoretical in the sense that the solutions are disconnected from real systems, even though they stem from concrete problems. The study is analytical in the sense that the solutions are compared based on their possible numbers of classes and on equations representing the values of the various structural quality attributes in function of these numbers of classes. The exploratory designs have been produced by studying the literature, by investigating open-source projects and by using design patterns. In addition to that, we have created a tool that helps practitioners in choosing the optimal design solution, according to their special needs.Results: The results of our research suggest that the decision of applying a design pattern is usually a trade-off, because patterns are not universally good or bad. Patterns typically improve certain aspects of software quality, while they might weaken some other.Conclusions: Concluding the proposed methodology is applicable for comparing patterns and alternative designs, and highlights existing threshold that when surpassed the design pattern is getting more or less beneficial than the alternative design. More specifically, the identification of such thresholds can become very useful for decision making during system design and refactoring."		mpatzoglou,; rantzeskou,; tamelos,	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2011.10.006		331-346			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2012	A methodology to assess the impact of design patterns on software quality	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2011.10.006	ELSEVIERRADARWEG	nan; Keywords; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
900	GameSE_abstract	MARBOWL: increasing the fun experience of shooting marbles	This paper focuses on the old school game of shooting marbles. We investigate which aspects of this tangible game make it popular and show how experienced fun can increase by elaborating such aspects through an iterative design process. A questionnaire and field study, tailored to the user group of primary school children aged 9-12 years old, revealed that aspects within areas of physical control, surface of the playground, opponent, and stakes of the game had the biggest influence on the fun experience of shooting marbles. A gameflow model and fun toolkit were used to improve the game in these respective areas. This resulted in a moving marble hole entitled Marbowl: a tangible marble game that augments existing game aspects such as timing, distance, surface, and other physical and environmental influences. A working prototype was field tested with 24 children at a primary school. Results show that different gameflow areas like concentration needed, playability, difficulty to win the game, and amount of challenge, increased in a positive way. Together these findings concluded that compared with the original marble game, children experienced a higher level of fun while playing with Marbowl.		aber, J; an den Hoven,	PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00779-011-0405-1		391-404			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2011	MARBOWL: increasing the fun experience of shooting marbles	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00779-011-0405-1	SPRINGER LONDON LTD	nan; Keywords; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
901	GameSE_abstract	Critical Success Factors to Improve the Game Development Process from a Developer's Perspective	The growth of the software game development industry is enormous and is gaining importance day by day. This growth imposes severe pressure and a number of issues and challenges on the game development community. Game development is a complex process, and one important game development choice is to consider the developer's perspective to produce good-quality software games by improving the game development process. The objective of this study is to provide a better understanding of the developer's dimension as a factor in software game success. It focuses mainly on an empirical investigation of the effect of key developer's factors on the software game development process and eventually on the quality of the resulting game. A quantitative survey was developed and conducted to identify key developer's factors for an enhanced game development process. For this study, the developed survey was used to test the research model and hypotheses. The results provide evidence that game development organizations must deal with multiple key factors to remain competitive and to handle high pressure in the software game industry. The main contribution of this paper is to investigate empirically the influence of key developer's factors on the game development process.	developer's perspective; software game; empirical investigation; good-quality game; game development process; game developer's factor	Aleem, Saiqa; Capretz, Luiz Fernando; Ahmed, Faheem	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11390-016-1673-z		925-950			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2016	Critical Success Factors to Improve the Game Development Process from a Developer's Perspective	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11390-016-1673-z	SPRINGER SINGAPORE PTE LTD	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

904	GameSE_abstract	Integrating a Usability Model into Model-Driven Web Development Processes	Usability evaluations should start early in the Web development process and occur repeatedly throughout all stages to ensure the quality of the Web application, not just when the product is completed. This paper presents a Web Usability Model, which is aligned with the SQUaRE standard, to evaluate usability at several stages of a Web development process that follows a Model-Driven Development (MDD) approach. The Web Usability Model is generic and must be operationalized into a concrete MDD method by specifying the relationships between the usability attributes of the Usability Model and the modeling primitives of the specific Web development method. To illustrate the feasibility of the approach, we present a case study where the Usability Model has been applied in the evaluation of the models that are produced during the Web application development process.

905	GameSE_abstract	An MDA‐based framework for collaborative business process modelling	Purpose - This paper aims to present a new approach for developing a framework based on a model driven architecture (MDA) for the modelling of technology‐independent collaborative processes.Design/methodology/approach - The paper suggests a new collaborative process modelling approach based on an MDA and a metamodelling technique. The research method, based on the design science approach, was started by identifying the characteristics of the collaborative processes, which distinguish them from the classical intraorganizational ones.

906	GameSE_abstract	Open Source Solutions for Vulnerability Assessment: A Comparative Analysis	As software applications continue to become more complex and attractive to cyber-attackers, enhancing resilience against cyber threats becomes essential. Aiming to provide more robust solutions, different approaches were proposed for vulnerability detection in different stages of the application life-cycle. This article explores three main approaches to application security: Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), and Software Composition Analysis (SCA). The analysis conducted in this work is focused on open-source solutions while considering commercial solutions to show contrast in the approaches taken and to better illustrate the different options available. It proposes a baseline comparison model to help evaluate and select the best solutions, using comparison criteria that are based on community standards. This work also identifies future opportunities for application security, highlighting some of the key challenges that still need to be addressed in order to fully protect against emerging threats, and proposes a workflow that combines the identified tools to be used for vulnerability assessments.

907	GameSE_abstract	A dual identification framework of online multiplayer video games: The case of massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs)	Video games have become a global economic, social, and consumption phenomenon. Within the video game industry, massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) have demonstrated unprecedented growth in recent years by attracting more than 50 million consumers who spend in excess of $12 billion annually. Yet, marketing researchers have not paid sufficient attention toward understanding consumption behaviors exhibited by MMORPG players. Drawing from research on MMORPGs, social identity theory, and online communities, this study examines the antecedents and consumption-related outcomes of players' (1) identification with MMORPGs and (2) identification with the MMORPG community. Analysis of data collected from 970 MMORPG players indicates that online games are socially driven and, although attachment with games is important, the relationships forged with fellow players drive consumption behaviors. Theoretical and managerial implications as well as limitations and directions for future research are offered.

908	GameSE_abstract	Measuring flow in gaming platforms	This paper describes the work in measuring flow while interacting with multi-platform games interfaces. We identified different gaming platforms which are mobile and non-mobile platform. The objective of the study is to identify and measure the variation of flow in different platforms. The early pilot data are collected through a survey form that are designed based on GameFlow criteria. The GameFlow criteria consist of eight elements which are: concentration; challenge; skills; control; clear goals; feedback; immersion and social interaction. In this exploratory study, the questionnaires of the survey are slightly altered from the GameFlow criteria identified in the previous work. From the early survey data collected, it shows the variation of player's expression and thought towards different kind of gaming platforms. Finding also shows that PC and Console are preferred by the respondent as their main platform to play games. The finding of this exploratory study can be used as additional guidelines in the future development of games application.

909	GameSE_abstract	The effect of games and simulations on higher education: a systematic literature review	The focus of higher education institutions is the preparation of future professionals. To achieve this aim, innovative teaching methods are often deployed, including games and simulations, which form the subject of this paper. As the field of digital games and simulations is ever maturing, this paper attempts to systematically review the literature relevant to games and simulation pedagogy in higher education. Two researchers collaborate to apply a qualitative method, coding and synthesizing the results using multiple criteria. The main objective is to study the impact of games and simulations with regard to achieving specific learning objectives. On balance, results indicate that games and/or simulations have a positive impact on learning goals. The researchers identify three learning outcomes when integrating games into the learning process: cognitive, behavioural, and affective. As a final step, the authors consolidate evidence for the benefit of academics and practitioners in higher education interested in the efficient use of games and simulations for pedagogical purposes. Such evidence also provides potential options and pathways for future research.

910	GameSE_abstract	Effects of the air sac thickness on ventilation by a 1D model of an avian respiratory system	Airflow in an avian respiratory system was simulated to study why birds affected with airsacculitis have respiratory distress. The airflow in the avian lung was modeled with a 1D electrical circuit and simulated for investigating what effect an increase in wall thickness of air sacs caused by airsacculitis has on flow in lung. The results demonstrated that thickening of the air sac wall caused anti-synchronization between an elastic recoiling force of the air sac walls and an intra-pleural pressure, bringing difficulties in expansion of air sacs to draw in airs during an inspiration period and thereby decreasing air to be pumped out during an expiration period. This was reflected in a decrease in air flow volume in parabronchi where gas exchange takes place. Therefore, it was concluded that airsacculitis causes imbalance in air flow dynamics in the avian lung and thus impairs breathing ability of birds.

The model estimates the entertainment value of game levels according to the presence of ""rhythm groups,"" which are defined as alternating periods of high and low challenge. The generative system represents a novel combination of genetic algorithms (GAs) and constraint satisfaction (CS) methods and uses the model as a fitness function for the generation of fun levels for two different games. This top-down approach improves upon typical bottom-up techniques in providing semantically meaningful parameters such as difficulty and player skill, in giving human designers considerable control over the output of the generative system, and in offering the ability to create levels for different types of games."

Exercise videogames may offer an attractive, sustainable alternative or supplement to traditional modes of exercise. This study compared exercise videogames with standard exercise modalities for improving uptake and maintenance of moderate to vigorous physical activity, and health risk indices. Study design: A three-arm clinical RCT including 12 weeks of supervised laboratory-based moderate to vigorous physical activity followed by 6 months follow-up. Setting/participants: This study was conducted at a university affiliated hospital research lab. Healthy, sedentary adults were eligible. Interventions: This study compared a 12-week program of supervised exercise videogames versus standard exercise (e.g., treadmill) versus control. Data were collected from January 2012 to September 2017 and analyzed in 2018. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity at end of treatment, assessed at 3 and 6 months post-intervention by using self-report and accelerometer data. Health risk indices (e.g., HbA1c, lipids) were also assessed. Results: Participants (N=283) had an average age of 46.2 +-13.5 years; 79% were female. At end of treatment, those in the exercise videogame arm engaged in 30 minutes/week more moderate to vigorous physical activity compared with standard exercise and 85 more minutes/week than controls (all p<0.05). Exercise videogame participants had greater reductions in cholesterol, HbA1c, and body fat versus other groups. Reductions in cholesterol were twice as large in exercise videogame versus standard participants. Conclusions: Exercise videogames produced greater uptake and maintenance of moderate to vigorous physical activity compared with standard exercise and improvements in multiple health risk indices. Exercise videogames may promote sustainable physical activity with significant health benefits. Trial registration: This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT03298919.

913	GameSE_abstract	Web-Based Geographic Information System for Member Distribution Mapping and Honey Sales at Inspirator Lebah Madu Indonesia (ILMI) With Prototype Methods	Nowadays, information systems are one of the most important things in an organization, especially in managing business processes. One of the businesses that can be assisted by the existence of an information system in managing its business processes is Inspirator Lebah Madu Indonesia (ILMI). ILMI is an association of honey bee practitioner organizations that has the intention to provide education to traditional breeders, and forest honey hunters on how to obtain and produce good, quality honey so that good benefits will be obtained for anyone who consumes it, but ILMI still uses the traditional system and do not have an information system that runs well. This research aims to create a web-based geographic information system for ILMI that can manage member distribution mapping and honey sales. The research method used in this study is a qualitative descriptive research method. This research resulted in a web-based application that manages applicant data, the map distribution of members, views the product, and generated revenue in hopes to assist ILMI for better productivity. In the end, this research is expected to increase the productivity of the people of West Java, especially the people who are involved in bee production.

914	GameSE_abstract	GameSpace: Methods and Evaluation for Casual Mobile Multiplayer Games	"GameSpace was a new kind of a research project: it involved close collaboration between academic researchers and the game industry, and it looked at the methodological issues involved in game creation rather than focusing on a single game product or technology. The project was funded by the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (Tekes) and five industry partners. The GameSpace industry partners were Nokia Research Center, Veikkaus, TeliaSonera Finland, Sulake Corporation and Digital Chocolate. The project ran for over two years, from August 1st 2006 to September 30th 2008.
GameSpace looked at the design and evaluation of games that are characterised by three main features: they are casual multiplayer games in a mobile use context. The goals for the project were threefold:

i? 1/2 To analyse the playability criteria of a successful mobile multiplayer game - especially in terms of casual gameplay.
i? 1/2 To develop and evaluate game design methodologies suited for the aforementioned games.
i? 1/2 To develop and test gameplay evaluation methods suited for mobile game development and research.

On a broader level, the project could be divided into two major themes. The first theme was design space, involving the study of casuality, mobility and mobile use context. The first phase of the project mostly consisted of conceptual analysis where a deeper and clearer understanding of the design space was sought. This phase mostly focused on the phenomenon of casual games. The aim was to understand the specific features that make a game casual. Casuality in games has not been studied rigorously before, which made it an interesting and important research topic. The second theme was methodological study on exploring and researching new approaches and methods for designing and evaluating casual mobile multiplayer games. The second theme was called design research.
The research project was executed by a series of workshops in which the industry partners and the research team worked in collaboration. The workshop themes followed the design space and the design research topics. The first three workshops focused on ideation methods for casual mobile multiplayer games. In these workshops, the GameSpace research team iteratively designed different ideation methods which would be used in the process of game ideation. Later the ideation methods formed a complete package, which was tested by the industry partners during a three-month actual use period. The next two workshops focused on low and medium fidelity prototyping. The workshops focused on practical prototyping work with various casual mobile multiplayer concepts. The sixth workshop focused on using expert evaluation methods in mobile game evaluation. In addition to the evaluation workshop, the GameSpace research team was involved in various case evaluations for different games which we!
re evaluated with both expert evaluation and user evaluation methods. The case evaluation work was done in close co-operation with the IPerG -project (Integrated Project on Pervasive Gaming). The last workshop expanded the scope of GameSpace by focusing on the user experiences with different games and game related services. This last workshop acted as a stepping stone for upcoming research projects and it will be reported on elsewhere.
The project produced interesting new knowledge on all of the major research areas of the project. Especially the findings on the phenomenon of casual games and the exploratory work on methodological idea generation are leading edge in game research. The prototyping and the evaluation phases also produced new knowledge and the research team produced several conference articles from all these research areas. In addition to the conference articles, the project produced two master's theses. The project received good feedback from the industry partners and led to two continuation projects, SoPlay and GaIn .
This final report contains the knowledge acquired from the GameSpace project. Like the project itself, this final report is divided into two main sections: design space and design research. The design space covers the special characteristics of casuality, mobility and the multiplayer aspects. The design research focuses on game ideation, game prototyping and game evaluation methods. In addition to this final report, the research team will produce a Flash-based application which reflects the content of this report on a broader level."	nan	Paavilainen, Janne; Kultima, Annakaisa; Kuittinen, Jussi; Mayra, Frans; Saarenpaa, Hannamari; Niemela, Johannes	nan	https://trepo.tuni.fi/handle/10024/65773	nan	nan	nan		Excluded	snowballing			2	GoogleScholar	2009	GameSpace: Methods and Evaluation for Casual Mobile Multiplayer Games	https://trepo.tuni.fi/handle/10024/65773	Tampere University of Technology	
915	GameSE_abstract	Effective marketing communication via social networking site: The moderating role of the social tie	Facebook provides a way of connecting with friends online that increases the effectiveness of Internet advertising. This study investigates what factors influence the impact of consumers sharing advertisement (peer-to-peer) on communication effectiveness. The conceptual framework relies on social capital and communication theory, including tie strength, type of message, and advertising literacy. To test the research hypotheses, the study carries out two experiments involving 346 participants. The results show that interactive advertising gains greater consumer attitude toward the ad and higher message-sharing intention than non-interactive advertising does. The social tie is an important factor in moderating the effects of the message format and advertising literacy on communication effectiveness. This research advances the social capital and communication literature by explaining the effectiveness of consumers sharing advertising based on Internet-mediated communication. Research findings provide managerial implication for companies to better plan online marketing strategies in this social networking era.

917	GameSE_abstract	Forensic analysis of a Sony PlayStation 4: A first look	The primary function of a games console is that of an entertainment system. However the latest iteration of these consoles has added a number of new interactive features that may prove of value to the digital investigator. This paper highlights the value of these consoles, in particular Sony's latest version of their PlayStation. This console provides a number of features including web browsing, downloading of material and chat functionality; all communication features that will be of interest to forensic investigators. In this paper we undertake an initial investigation of the PlayStation 4 games console. This paper identifies potential information sources of forensic value with the PlayStation 4 and provides a method for acquiring information in a forensically sound manner. In particular issues with the online and offline investigative process are also identified.

918	GameSE_abstract	When the players are not expectation maximizers	Much of Game Theory, including the Nash equilibrium concept, is based on the assumption that players are expectation maximizers. It is known that if players are risk averse, games may no longer have Nash equilibria ([11,6]. We show that 1. Under risk aversion (convex risk valuations), and for almost all games, there are no mixed Nash equilibria, and thus either there is a pure equilibrium or there are no equilibria at all, and, 2. For a variety of important valuations other than expectation, it is NP-complete to determine if games between such players have a Nash equilibrium.

919	GameSE_abstract	A STEP TOWARDS PREVENTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IN SOFTWARE PROJECTS	Software development projects complexities have climbed up drastically over the last few decades. This increase in complexity has been accompanied by high failure rates in software projects. This is mainly due to the poorly-applied risk management process while developing software projects. A recent research revealed that most software development organizations practice the development process and the risk management process as two separate isolated processes, and the integration between them is still in its infancy. In this research we believe that if risk management is integrated into the software development process, this will positively reflect on the development process, greatly affect projects outcomes, and remarkably increase the success rate. In order to achieve this integration, in this paper we propose a preventive risk management model that integrates risk management into the software development process.

920	GameSE_abstract	The Design, Play, and Experience Framework	This chapter introduces a framework for the design of serious games for learning, called the design, play, and experience framework. The author argues that the great potential of serious games will not be realized without a formal design approach. To that end, the author presents and thoroughly explains the design, play, and experience framework which provides a formal approach to designing the learning, storytelling, game play, user experience, and technology components of a serious game. The author concludes by detailing how the framework provides a common language to discuss serious game design, a methodology to analyze a design, and a process to design a serious game for learning.

921	GameSE_abstract	Component based game development a solution to escalating costs and expanding deadlines?	Expanding deadlines and escalating costs have notoriously plagued the game industry. Although the majority of the game development costs are spent on art and animation, significant cost reductions and more importantly reductions in development time can be achieved when developers use off the shelf components rather than develop them from scratch. However, many game developers struggle with component integration and managing the complexity of their architectures. This paper gives an overview of developing games with components, presents a reference architecture that outlines the relevant areas of reuse and signifies some of the problems with developing components unique to the domain of games.	games; COTS; game architectures	Folmer, Eelke	Component-Based Software Engineering, Proceedings	https://doi.org/10.1145/2304736.2304748		66-73			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science		CBSE - Component based game development: a solution to escalating costs and expanding deadlines?	https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000248082700005	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLINHEIDELBERGER PLATZ	nan; References; Year; Bibtex

923	GameSE_abstract	Generic structures, generic experiences: A cognitive experientialist approach to video game analysis	The article discusses the issue of how to categorize video games - not the medium of video games, but individual video games. As a lead in to this discussion, the article discusses video game specificity and genericity and moves on to genre theory. On the basis of this discussion, a cognitive experientialist genre framework is sketched, which incorporates both general points from genre theory and theories more specific to the video game domain.

924	GameSE_abstract	EGameFlow: A scale to measure learners' enjoyment of e-learning games	"In an effective e-learning game, the learner's enjoyment acts as a catalyst to encourage his/her learning initiative. Therefore, the availability of a scale that effectively measures the enjoyment offered by e-learning games assist the game designer to understanding the strength and flaw of the game efficiently from the learner's points of view. E-learning games are aimed at the achievement of learning objectives via the creation of a flow effect. Thus, this study is based on Sweetser's & Wyeth's framework to develop a more rigorous scale that assesses user enjoyment of e-learning games. The scale developed in the present study consists of eight dimensions: Immersion, social interaction, challenge, goal clarity, feedback, concentration, control, and knowledge improvement. Four learning games employed in a university's online learning course ""Introduction to Software Application"" were used as the instruments of scale verification. Survey questionnaires were distributed to students taking the course and 166 valid samples were subsequently collected. The results showed that the validity and reliability of the scale, EGameFlow, were satisfactory. Thus, the measurement is an effective tool for evaluating the level of enjoyment provided by e-learning games to their users."

925	GameSE_abstract	EMPIRICAL EVALUATION OF CLASSIFIERS FOR SOFTWARE RISK MANAGEMENT	Software development involves plenty of risks, and errors exist in software modules represent a major kind of risk. Software defect prediction techniques and tools that identify software errors play a crucial role in software risk management. Among software defect prediction techniques, classification is a commonly used approach. Various types of classifiers have been applied to software defect prediction in recent years. How to select an adequate classifier (or set of classifiers) to identify error prone software modules is an important task for software development organizations. There are many different measures for classifiers and each measure is intended for assessing different aspect of a classifier. This paper developed a performance metric that combines various measures to evaluate the quality of classifiers for software defect prediction. The performance metric is analyzed experimentally using 13 classifiers on 11 public domain software defect datasets. The results of the experiment indicate that support vector machines (SVM), C4.5 algorithm, and K-nearest-neighbor algorithm ranked the top three classifiers.

926	GameSE_abstract	Comparison of a Traditional and a Video Game Based Balance Training Program	"The aim of the present study is to compare the efficiency of traditional and video game based balance training programs. 22 customers of a health care
centre (age: M = 47.6 yrs; SD = 13.1) volunteered to participate in the experiment. They were randomly assigned to two experimental groups. One group underwent a traditional training program, while the other group trained using the Nintendo Wii Fit TM Balance Board. Between pre and post test procedures, training sessions were performed three times a week for three weeks. In addition to five balance tests (SEBT, ball-handling, two video games, dynamic balance), a questionnaire was applied concerning mood state, self-efficacy, physical activity enjoyment, flow and subjective experience in order to evaluate psychological effects of the interventions. Two-factor analyses of variance showed both general and differential improvements of the two groups for pre and post test measures. Both groups improved their balance performance in 4 of five tests. The traditional group showed a significantly greater improvement in two tests (SEBT: F(1,20) = 8.907, p = .007, ?2 = .308; ball-handling: F(1,20) = 13.578, p = .001, ?2 = .404),
whereas the Wii group showed a significantly greater improvement in one test (Ski Slalom (F(1,20) = 5.101, p = .035, ?2 = .203). Psychological questionnaires revealed neither significant pre-post effects nor differences between the groups for pre and post test measurements. The results confirm that the Nintendo Wii Fit TM may be a suitable medium
of training balance in prevention and rehabilitation of adults. Specific effects of training are more pronounced than transfer between virtual and real performance."

927	GameSE_abstract	Journey, a shared virtual space middleware	The complexity of developing multiplayer games, along with their popularity, has grown tremendously in the recent years. The most complex of these, Massively Multiplayer Games (MMOGs), require developers to deal with many issues, such as scalability, reliability and cheat prevention. Although individual solutions to these problems exists, very little academic work has been done to address all these issues simultaneously. In addition, experimentation in these areas can require a significant implementation effort.

928	GameSE_abstract	An Empirical Analysis of Software Vendors' Patch Release Behavior: Impact of Vulnerability Disclosure	A key aspect of better and more secure software is timely patch release by software vendors for the vulnerabilities in their products. Software vulnerability disclosure, which refers to the publication of vulnerability information, has generated intense debate. An important consideration in this debate is the behavior of software vendors. How quickly do vendors patch vulnerabilities and how does disclosure affect patch release time? This paper compiles a unique data set from the Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT) and SecurityFocus to answer this question. Our results suggest that disclosure accelerates patch release. The instantaneous probability of releasing the patch rises by nearly two and a half times because of disclosure. Open source vendors release patches more quickly than closed source vendors. Vendors are more responsive to more severe vulnerabilities. We also find that vendors respond more slowly to vulnerabilities not disclosed by CERT. We verify our results by using another publicly available data set and find that results are consistent. We also show how our estimates can aid policy makers in their decision making.	security vulnerability; disclosure policy; patch release time; open source vendors; information security; software vendors; hazard model	Arora, Ashish; Krishnan, Ramayya; Telang, Rahul; Yang, Yubao	INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH	https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.1080.0226		115-132			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2010	An Empirical Analysis of Software Vendors' Patch Release Behavior: Impact of Vulnerability Disclosure	https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.1080.0226	INFORMS	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
929	GameSE_abstract	"""What Went Right and What Went Wrong"": An Analysis of 155 Postmortems from Game Development"	In game development, software teams often conduct postmortems to reflect on what went well and what went wrong in a project. The postmortems are shared publicly on gaming sites or at developer conferences. In this paper, we present an analysis of 155 postmortems published on the gaming site Gamasutra.com. We identify characteristics of game development, link the characteristics to positive and negative experiences in the postmortems and distill a set of best practices and pitfalls for game development.

930	GameSE_abstract	Software Licenses in Context: The Challenge of Heterogeneously-Licensed Systems	The prevailing approach to free/open source software and licenses has been that each system is developed, distributed, and used under the terms of a single license. But it is increasingly common for information systems and other software to be composed with components from a variety of sources, and with a diversity of licenses. This may result in possible license conflicts and organizational liability for failure to fulfill license obligations. Research and practice to date have not kept up with this sea-change in software licensing arising from free/open source software development. System consumers and users consequently rely on ad hoc heuristics (or costly legal advice) to determine which license rights and obligations are in effect, often with less than optimal results; consulting services are offered to identify unknowing unauthorized use of licensed software in information systems; and researchers have shown how the choice of a (single) specific license for a product affects project success and system adoption. Legal scholars have examined how pairs of software licenses conflict but only in simple contexts. We present an approach for understanding and modeling software licenses, as well as for analyzing conflicts among groups of licenses in realistic system contexts, and for guiding the acquisition, integration, or development of systems with free/open source components in such an environment. This work is based on an empirical analysis of representative software licenses and of heterogeneously-licensed systems. Our approach provides guidance for achieving a i? 1/2best-of-breedi? 1/2 component strategy while obtaining desired license rights in exchange for acceptable obligations.

931	GameSE_abstract	Measure it? Manage it? Ignore it? software practitioners and technical debt	The technical debt metaphor is widely used to encapsulate numerous software quality problems. The metaphor is attractive to practitioners as it communicates to both technical and nontechnical audiences that if quality problems are not addressed, things may get worse. However, it is unclear whether there are practices that move this metaphor beyond a mere communication mechanism. Existing studies of technical debt have largely focused on code metrics and small surveys of developers. In this paper, we report on our survey of 1,831 participants, primarily software engineers and architects working in long-lived, software-intensive projects from three large organizations, and follow-up interviews of seven software engineers. We analyzed our data using both nonparametric statistics and qualitative text analysis. We found that architectural decisions are the most important source of technical debt. Furthermore, while respondents believe the metaphor is itself important for communication, existing tools are not currently helpful in managing the details. We use our results to motivate a technical debt timeline to focus management and tooling approaches.

Drawing on this framework, the author proposes a multifaceted methodological approach to the study of games and the play experience. Drawing on user-created mods (modifications) in the game World of Warcraft and an analysis of a raid encounter there, a discussion is undertaken about the relationship between technological artifacts, game experience, and sociality. Primary to the consideration is an argument for the centralizing the interrelation of a variety of actors and nodes when analyzing lived play in computer games.	massively multiplayer online game; mods; assemblage; actor network theory; methodology	Taylor, T.

Mammoth provides a modular architecture where different components, such as the network engine, the replication engine, or interest management, can easily be replaced. Subgames allow a researcher to define different game goals, for instance, in order to evaluate the effects of different team-play tactics on the game performance. Mammoth also offers a modular and flexible infrastructure for the definition of non-player characters with behavior controlled by complex artificial intelligence algorithms. This paper focuses on the Mammoth architecture, demonstrating how good design practices can be used to create a modular framework where researchers from different research domains can conduct their experiments. The effectiveness of the architecture is demonstrated by several successful research projects accomplished using the Mammoth framework.

936	GameSE_abstract	Software licenses in context: The challenge of heterogeneously-licensed systems	"The prevailing approach to free/open source software and licenses has been that each system is developed, distributed, and used under the terms of a single license. But it is increasingly common for information systems and other software to be composed with components from a variety of sources, and with a diversity of licenses. This may result in possible license conflicts and organizational liability for failure to fulfill license obligations. Research and practice to date have not kept up with this sea-change in software licensing arising from free/open source software development. System consumers and users consequently rely on ad hoc heuristics (or costly legal advice) to determine which license rights and obligations are in effect, often with less than optimal results; consulting services are offered to identify unknowing unauthorized use of licensed software in information systems; and researchers have shown how the choice of a (single) specific license for a product affects project success and system adoption. Legal scholars have examined how pairs of software licenses conflict but only in simple contexts. We present an approach for understanding and modeling software licenses, as well as for analyzing conflicts among groups of licenses in realistic system contexts, and for guiding the acquisition, integration, or development of systems with free/open source components in such an environment. This work is based on an empirical analysis of representative software licenses and of heterogeneously-licensed systems. Our approach provides guidance for achieving a ""best-of-breed"" component strategy while obtaining desired license rights in exchange for acceptable obligations."

939	GameSE_abstract	Extensibility and modularity for model driven engineering environments	Model Driven Engineering has shown the feasibility to generate tools (editors, analyzers ...) from models and for a domain. Unfortunately these generated tools are much focused while a large application spans different domains and different activities; currently these tools do not support concurrent engineering, and incomplete life cycle support. In a similar way we developed a technology capable of generating a complete Computer Aided Domain Specific Environment (CADSE) from a set of model and metamodels describing the specific domain and the environment behavior. Our technology solves the above two problems, allowing defining a number of CADSE addressing specific activities, as extensions and adaptation of a core CADSE; and relying on workspaces. CADSEs workspaces are model driven; they contain tools, models and usual artifacts (code, documents...); they support different activities by switching from an activity to another one, and concurrent engineering is supported through import/commit applied to models, metamodels and artifacts.

940	GameSE_abstract	When the Game Is Not Enough: Motivations and Practices Among Computer Game Modding Culture	The actual meanings computer game modders attach to their actions and practices remain heavily underresearched. This article takes a look at the attitudes and everyday practices of the people who make game modifications, with special focus on the forms and consequences of collaboration between hobbyists. The case discussed in the article is the shooter-game Operation Flashpoint (OFP) and the modding scene around it. The article proposes that there is no such thing as an average computer game modder. It is suggested that the distinctions can be drawn based on the objective of projects (missions, add-ons, mods), modder motivations (playing, hacking, researching, self-expression, cooperation), and notions on the ownership and potential commercialization of their work. Given the forecasts concerning the growing significance of player-made content, this study can offer some down-to-earth findings from the long established tradition of game modding.	computer game modifications; modding; game fans; player production	Sotamaa, Olli	GAMES AND CULTURE	https://doi.org/10.1177/1555412009359765		239-255			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2010	When the Game Is Not Enough: Motivations and Practices Among Computer Game Modding Culture	https://doi.org/10.1177/1555412009359765	SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
941	GameSE_abstract	Towards a formalism-based toolkit for automotive applications	The success of a number of projects has been shown to be significantly improved by the use of a formalism. However, there remains an open issue: to what extent can a development process based on a singular formal notation and method succeed. The majority of approaches demonstrate a low level of flexibility by attempting to use a single notation to express all of the different aspects encountered in software development. Often, these approaches leave a number of scalability issues open. We prefer a more eclectic approach. In our experience, the use of a formalism-based toolkit with adequate notations for each development phase is a viable solution. Following this principle, any specific notation is used only where and when it is really suitable and not necessarily over the entire software lifecycle. The approach explored in this article is perhaps slowly emerging in practice - we hope to accelerate its adoption. However, the major challenge is still finding the best way to instantiate it for each specific application scenario. In this work, we describe a development process and method for automotive applications which consists of five phases. The process recognizes the need for having adequate (and tailored) notations (Problem Frames, Requirements State Machine Language, and Event-B) for each development phase as well as direct traceability between the documents produced during each phase. This allows for a stepwise verification/validation of the system under development. The ideas for the formal development method have evolved over two significant case studies carried out in the DEPLOY project.

942	GameSE_abstract	Deriving Specifications of Dependable Systems: toward a Method	Abstract:This paper proposes a method for deriving formal specifications of systems. To accomplish this task we pass through a non trivial number of steps, concepts and tools where the first one, the most important, is the concept of method itself, since we realized that computer science has a proliferation of languages but very few methods. We also propose the idea of Layered Fault Tolerant Specification (LFTS) to make the method extensible to dependable systems. The principle is layering the specification, for the sake of clarity, in (at least) two different levels, the first one for the normal behavior and the others (if more than one) for the abnormal. The abnormal behavior is described in terms of an Error Injector (EI) which represents a model of the erroneous interference coming from the environment. This structure has been inspired by the notion of idealized fault tolerant component but the combination of LFTS and EI using rely guarantee thinking to describe interference can be considered one of the main contributions of this work. The progress toward this method and the way to layer specifications has been made experimenting on the Transportation and the Automotive Case Studies of the DEPLOY project.

943	GameSE_abstract	MCMAS: an open-source model checker for the verification of multi-agent systems	We present MCMAS, a model checker for the verification of multi-agent systems. MCMAS supports efficient symbolic techniques for the verification of multi-agent systems against specifications representing temporal, epistemic and strategic properties. We present the underlying semantics of the specification language supported and the algorithms implemented in MCMAS, including its fairness and counterexample generation features. We provide a detailed description of the implementation.

Little work has been done on the emerging digital game industry. In this paper we explore how data can drive game design and production decisions in game development. We define a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data sources, broken down into three broad categories: internal testing, external testing, and subjective evaluations. We present preliminary results of a case study of how data collected from users of a released game can inform subsequent development.

946	GameSE_abstract	Intellectual property rights requirements for heterogeneously-licensed systems	Heterogeneously-licensed systems pose new challenges to analysts and system architects. Appropriate intellectual property rights must be available for the installed system, but without unnecessarily restricting other requirements, the system architecture, and the choice of components both initially and as it evolves. Such systems are increasingly common and important in e-business, game development, and other domains. Our semantic parameterization analysis of open-source licenses confirms that while most licenses present few roadblocks, reciprocal licenses such as the GNU General Public License produce knotty constraints that cannot be effectively managed without analysis of the system's license architecture. Our automated tool supports intellectual property requirements management and license architecture evolution. We validate our approach on an existing heterogeneously-licensed system.

949	GameSE_abstract	Game design tools: Time to evaluate	The art form of the video game has a very idiosyncratic reliance on the process and practice of its designers. We work with creative and computational problems that form a web of deep complexity. And yet, as I have noticed in my professional practice as a game designer, we do not use tools to support our design process. For more than a decade, designers and researchers have argued for the development and use of both conceptual and concrete tools. To this end, formal and semi-formal game design models have been proposed and, more recently, experimental software-based tools have been developed by the research community. To date, however, none of these tools or models have been adopted into mainstream practice within the game design community. In this paper I argue that it is difficult, if not methodologically flawed, to assess the work in the field of game design support without more qualitative data on how such tools fare in actual game design practice. Evaluation research would be an essential contribution towards answering the question of whether i? 1/2 and if so, how - these experimental formal models and tools can support and improve the game design process.	game design; design tools; ludocore; machinations; game atoms; game diagramming	Katharine, Neil	Proceedings of Nordic DiGRA 2012 Conference	https://dl.digra.org/index.php/dl/article/view/606	nan	nan	"@Conference{digra606, title =""Game design tools: Time to evaluate"", year = ""2012"", author = ""Neil, Katharine"", publisher = ""DiGRA"", address = ""Tampere"", howpublished = ""\url{https://dl.digra.org/index.php/dl/article/view/606}"", booktitle = ""Proceedings of Nordic DiGRA 2012 Conference""}"		Excluded	snowballing			2	GoogleScholar	2012	Game Design Tools: Time to Evaluate	https://dl.digra.org/index.php/dl/article/view/606	Digital Games Research Association	
950	GameSE_abstract	Modeling and formal veriﬁcation of gaming storylines	Video games are becoming more and more interactive with increasingly complex plots. These plots typically involve multiple parallel storylines that may converge and diverge based on player actions. This may lead to situations that are inconsistent or impassable. Current techniques for planning and testing game plots involve naive means such as text documents, spreadsheets, and critical path testing. Recent academic research [1] [2] [3] examines the design planning problems, but neglect testing and veriﬁcation of the possible plot lines. These complex plots have thus until now been handled inadequately due to a lack of a formal methodology and tools to support them. In this dissertation, we describe how we develop methods to 1) characterize storylines (SChar), 2) deﬁne a storyline description language (SDL), and 3) create a storyline veriﬁcation tool based in formal veriﬁcation techniques (StoCk) that use our SDL as input. SChar (Storyline Characterization) help game developers characterize the category of story line they are working on (e.g. linear, branching and plot) through a tool that give a set of guided questions. Our SDL allows its users to describe storylines in a consistent format similar to how they reason about storylines, but in such a way that it can be used for formal veriﬁcation. StoCk accepts storylines, described in SDL, to be formally veriﬁed using SPIN for errors. StoCk is also examined in three common use cases found in the gaming industry used as a tool 1) during storyline creation 2) during quality assurance and 3) during storyline implementation. The combination of SChar, SDL, and StoCk provides designers, writers, and developers a novel methodology and tools to verify consistency in large and complex game plots.Electrical and Computer Engineerin		Holloway, Lane Thomas							Excluded	snowballing			2						
951	GameSE_abstract	Resisting the perpetual update: Struggles against protocological power in video games	This article explores the evolution of video game updates and patches from a mechanism of customer support to a tool of control over the way games are played in the ecosystem of digital gaming platforms. It charts a historical trajectory across various cultural industries, including literary publishing, screen industries, and music, to show a shift from multiplicity of editions to one perpetually updated contingent commodity. Focusing on the issues of power and control enabled by the always-online platforms, the analysis shows that previously updating was often voluntary. However, now players must actively resist patches if they wish to play the game on their own terms. As illustrated by three case studies of update resistance, developers, publishers, and platform holders wield protocological power, which can be successfully opposed-although the outcome often remains localized and tends to alter a specific iteration of protocol and not the underlying infrastructure.

953	GameSE_abstract	Software Architectures and the Creative Processes in Game Development	Game development is different from traditional software engineering in that there are no real functional requirements and the customers buy and use the software only because it is engaging and fun. This article investigates how game developers think about and use software architecture in the development of games. Further, it looks at how creative development processes are managed and supported. The results presented in this article come from responses to a questionnaire and a survey among thirteen game developers. The research questions answered in this study are: what role does the software architecture play in game development, how do game developers manage changes to the software architecture, how are creative development processes managed and supported, and how has game development evolved the last couple of years. Some of our findings are that software architectures play a central role in game development where the focus is mainly on achieving software with good performance and high modifiability, creative processes are supported through flexible game engines and tools, use of scripting and dynamic loading of assets, and feature-based teams with both creative and technical professions represented, and game developers are incrementally using more game-specific engines, tools and middleware in their development now compared to earlier.

954	GameSE_abstract	Behind the game: Exploring the twitch streaming platform	Twitch is a streaming platform that lets users broadcast their screen whilst playing games. People can share their game experience and interact with others in real time. Twitch has now become the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic in the US. This paper explores the unique nature of this platform over a 11 month dataset. We find that Twitch is very different to existing video platforms, with a small number of games consistently achieving phenomenal dominance. We find a complex game ecosystem combining consistently popular games over years, newly released games enjoying bursts of popularity, and even old games appearing on the platform. Despite a strong skew of views across channels, the top ranked channels, although taking a significant share of the viewers, exhibit unexpectedly high churn. The reason behind this churn lies within another unique feature of this ecosystem, namely tournaments, live events that last for a limited amount of time but are capable of attracting a huge share of views when they take place, as well as dominate the views of the related games. Overall, our work reveals a complex and rich ecosystem, very different from existing user generated content platforms.

955	GameSE_abstract	Measuring social behaviour as an indicator of experience	This paper explores and evaluates two techniques that measure aspects of social behaviour as an indicator of experience. The rationale driving the work is the idea that experience is entwined with social interaction and so, while experience itself is difficult to quantify, we might tap into it by measuring aspects of conversation that are related to it. Two techniques are considered as possible ways of doing this: (i) process measures of social behaviour derived from video analysis and (ii) thin-slice ratings ascribed by naive judges. Regarding (i), process measures of conversational equality, freedom and number of turns are shown to be reliable, sensitive and linked to unfolding experience. Regarding (ii), a Thin Slice Enjoyment Scale is developed and shown to be a reliable and less time-consuming, but also less sensitive, alternative to the process measures. Both methods are of interest to researchers and practitioners who would wish to assess user experience in a group context. Additionally, analysis of the process measures is of broader relevance to researchers who conduct quantitative analyses of talk.	unfolding experience; empathic experience; process measure; quantitative; video analysis; thin slice	Lindley, Sian E.; Monk, Andrew F.

956	GameSE_abstract	Understanding user participation in online communities: A systematic literature review of empirical studies	Online communities have become a popular and widely studied research topic. As active participation has been acknowledged as essential for the sustainability of the communities, research has focused largely on the most visible participants with the greatest financial value for community providers. However, users can engage with the sites in different ways, which calls for a more diverse classification of participation, instead of a simple active-passive dichotomy. This systematic literature review discusses empirical studies on online community participation. The results indicate that despite the large amount of research conducted on the topic, a theoretical and conceptual framework for user participation remains undefined as most of the research has approached participation in terms of its quantity. The complexity of online participation and its implications for methodology in future studies is discussed.

957	GameSE_abstract	Adding user experience into the interactive service design loop: a persona-based approach	Approaches to service design share human-computer interaction's (HCI's) commitment to developing with and for people useful, usable and accessible services. However, there has been little explicit interaction between the emerging service sciences and the interaction design communities. This article explores HCI's actual position and opportunities to service design and requirements and vice versa. We propose a design framework for service-oriented interactive systems integrating the concept of persona. This enables to extract relevant elements towards deriving the design of the main functionalities of the user interface. This framework is applied to a case study of the e-maintenance of an agro-alimentary group.	human-computer interaction; persona; service-oriented architecture; interactive Web services; e-maintenance	Idoughi, Djilali; Seffah, Ahmed; Kolski, Christophe	BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY	https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2011.563799		287-303			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2012	Adding user experience into the interactive service design loop: a persona-based approach	https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2011.563799	TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

959	GameSE_abstract	Game Design by Numbers: Instrumental Play and the Quantitative Shift in the Digital Game Industry	"This dissertation chronicles ideological, technological and economic changes in the digital game industry, focusing on how games are transforming as play becomes
instrumentalized. It pays particular attention to the struggles of developers as they search for creative freedom and autonomy in a risk-averse industry. It makes original
contributions to the literature on games by situating and explaining industiy-wide shifts in terms of the socio-economics of game development and the rationalities that drive
individual developers. It contributes to social theory more generally by explaining how transformations in play, games, and creativity are linked to much wider adaptations in the
operation of capitalism and how it is justified to both workers and consumers. I use ground-level accounts from those within the game industry to describe how new media technologies interact with socio-economic forces, detailing the adaptability of capitalist modes of production in the face of critique. I show how definitions of 'games'
and 'play' are changing as they come into contact with technology, allowing games to be reformulated in powerful new ways, so games are not only tools of entertainment but also tools of governance. I argue that the collective valuation of objective quantitative data and the belief in the fallibility of individual creative autonomy has turned game design into ""design by numbers"". The complementary themes of this thesis are bound together by references to the ""New Spirit of Capitalism"" (Boltanski and Chiapello 2007, 2005), which explains how capitalism is continually reorganizing itself, adapting the language and spirit of 1960s counterculture and emphasizing freedom in order to drive though new, more efficient, work practices and more subde forms of exploitation. This ""New Spirit"" accounts for the current upheavals in the game industry. Changes to the Spirit of Capitalism have initiated tectonic shifts, reforming the geography of the game industry and creating fissures in the landscape that allow new game sectors to emerge, while others struggle to avoid being buried. In turn, innovations from the game industry, particularly the emphasis on datadriven design, shore up the weaknesses in the New Spirit of Capitalism, allowing it to operate more successfully."	digital games; game development; game industry; Instrumentalization of Play; New Spirit of Capitalism; governance; surveillance	Whitson, Jennifer R.

960	GameSE_abstract	Unveiling group characteristics in online social games: a socio-economic analysis	Understanding the group characteristics in MMORPGs is important in user behavior studies since people tend to gather together and form groups due to their inherent nature. In this paper, we analyze the group activities of users in Aion, one of the largest MMORPGs, based on the records of the activities of 94,497 users. In particular, we focus on (i) how social interactions within a group differ from the ones across groups, (ii) what makes a group rise, sustain, or fall, (iii) how group members join and leave a group, and (iv) what makes a group end. We first find that structural patterns of social interactions within a group are more likely to be close-knit and reciprocative than the ones across groups. We also observe that members in a rising group (i.e., the number of members increases) are more cohesive, and communicate with more evenly within the group than the ones in other groups. Our analysis further reveals that if a group is not cohesive, not actively communicating, or not evenly communicating among members, members of the group tend to leave.	socio-economic analysis;  social interactions;  online social game;  group characteristics;  group activity;  MMORPG	Chung, Taejoong; Han, Jinyoung; Choi, Daejin; Kwon, Taekyoung Ted; Kim, Huy Kang; Choi, Yanghee	WWW '14: Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World wide web	https://doi.org/10.1145/2566486.2568011		889-900	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2566486.2568011,

961	GameSE_abstract	Comparing Inspections and User Testing for the Evaluation of Virtual Environments	This article describes an experiment comparing three Usability Evaluation Methods: User Testing (UT), Document-based Inspection (DI), and Expert Inspection (EI) for evaluating Virtual Environments (VEs). Twenty-nine individuals (10 end-users and 19 junior usability experts) participated during 1 hr each in the evaluation of two VEs (a training VE and a 3D map). Quantitative results of the comparison show that the effectiveness of UT and DI is significantly better than the effectiveness of EI. For each method, results show their problem coverage: DI- and UT-based diagnoses lead to more problem diversity than EI. The overlap of identified problems amounts to 22% between UT and DI, 20% between DI and EI, and 12% between EI and UT for both virtual environments. The identification impact of the whole set of usability problems is 60% for DI, 57% for UT, and only 36% for EI for both virtual environments. Also reliability of UT and DI is significantly better than reliability of EI. In addition, a qualitative analysis identified 35 classes describing the profile of usability problems found with each method. It shows that UT seems particularly efficient for the diagnosis of problems that require a particular state of interaction to be detectable. On the other hand, DI supports the identification of problems directly observable, often related to learnability and basic usability. This study shows that DI could be viewed as a o4-wheel drive SUV evaluation typeo (less powerful under certain conditions but able to go everywhere, with any driver), whereas UT could be viewed as a oFormula 1 car evaluation typeo (more powerful but requiring adequate road and a very skilled driver). EI is found (considering all metrics) to be not efficient enough to evaluate usability of VEs.		Bach, Cedric; Scapin, Dominique L.

962	GameSE_abstract	Cheating in Online Games: A Social Network Perspective	Online gaming is a multi-billion dollar industry that entertains a large, global population. One unfortunate phenomenon, however, poisons the competition and spoils the fun: cheating. The costs of cheating span from industry-supported expenditures to detect and limit it, to victims' monetary losses due to cyber crime.This article studies cheaters in the Steam Community, an online social network built on top of the world's dominant digital game delivery platform. We collected information about more than 12 million gamers connected in a global social network, of which more than 700 thousand have their profiles flagged as cheaters. We also observed timing information of the cheater flags, as well as the dynamics of the cheaters' social neighborhoods.We discovered that cheaters are well embedded in the social and interaction networks: their network position is largely indistinguishable from that of fair players. Moreover, we noticed that the number of cheaters is not correlated with the geographical, real-world population density, or with the local popularity of the Steam Community. Also, we observed a social penalty involved with being labeled as a cheater: cheaters lose friends immediately after the cheating label is publicly applied.Most importantly, we observed that cheating behavior spreads through a social mechanism: the number of cheater friends of a fair player is correlated with the likelihood of her becoming a cheater in the future. This allows us to propose ideas for limiting cheating contagion.

We also observed timing information of the cheater flags, as well as the dynamics of the cheaters' social neighborhoods.We discovered that cheaters are well embedded in the social and interaction networks: their network position is largely indistinguishable from that of fair players. Moreover, we noticed that the number of cheaters is not correlated with the geographical, real-world population density, or with the local popularity of the Steam Community. Also, we observed a social penalty involved with being labeled as a cheater: cheaters lose friends immediately after the cheating label is publicly applied.Most importantly, we observed that cheating behavior spreads through a social mechanism: the number of cheater friends of a fair player is correlated with the likelihood of her becoming a cheater in the future. This allows us to propose ideas for limiting cheating contagion."",

963	GameSE_abstract	"""Frontline Mediators"" an ethnographic study of online welfare applications at the public library"	"This paper examines the work of ""frontline mediators,"" a term used by public librarians to describe the practice of facilitating the use of online welfare applications. As welfare agencies closed their offices and required clients to access services online, public librarians operating in low-income communities adopted new practices to facilitate their clients' use of web applications for welfare and other relevant public services. Pulling from interviews and observations from a multi-year ethnographic study, I discuss the emergence of frontline mediators, and examine the key practices and attributes involved with their work. Frontline mediators care for their clients and their clients' information needs. Thus, I argue the idea of caring relationships should be at the center of public service design strategy. The frontline mediator case study offers relevant lessons for human-computer interaction and design researchers interested in broader questions of democracy, civic engagement, and public service."

964	GameSE_abstract	Digital games as creativity enablers for children	This article deals with the issue of creativity and the way this can be supported within technology-enhanced learning experiments. Drawing on a long-term research project in the field of games-based learning, the article describes the methodology adopted during the in-field experiments carried out with the aim of developing young children's creativity. The results of the study, which are presented and discussed, confirm the hypothesis that digital tools can contribute to fostering creativity. As a matter of fact, the analysis of the available data showed that during the 3-year study, students' creative skills and attitudes appreciably increased, in particular those related to figuring out and enacting original solution strategies for the digital games at hand.	creativity; games-based learning; digital mind games; creativity indicators; technology-enhanced learning; children	Ott, Michela; Pozzi, Francesca	BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY	https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2010.526148		1011-1019			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2012	Digital games as creativity enablers for children	https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2010.526148	TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

967	GameSE_abstract	Descriptive Feedback on Interns' Performance using a text mining approach	Descriptive feedback is a powerful tool to identify the strength and the areas that need improvement of a certain program. Text analysis using the text mining approach is the most common application in the text processing field. This study aimed to determine the potentials and the imperfections of the IT interns while taking the internship program using a Naive Bayes text classification. Text dataset from the internship program of the IT curriculum under the College of Computer Studies and Information Technology (CCSIT) of Southern Leyte State University (SLSU) was the input of the study. This study applied the text mining application using the Naive Bayes text classification to evaluate the performance of the IT interns. Results show that the IT interns of the program were proficient and technically competent but had a problem with their communication skills. The model has obtained an acceptable accuracy rating of 87.55% in predicting the performance of the students. Based on the results, the IT interns were efficient in the IT-related task. However, there is a need to improve interns' communication skills. The management should think about a possible bridging program that will help the student to develop their communication skills.

969	GameSE_abstract	Weak inter-rater reliability in heuristic evaluation of video games	Heuristic evaluation promises to be a low-cost usability evaluation method, but is fraught with problems of subjective interpretation, and a proliferation of competing and contradictory heuristic lists. This is particularly true in the field of games research where no rigorous comparative validation has yet been published. In order to validate the available heuristics, a user test of a commercial game is conducted with 6 participants in which 88 issues are identified, against which 146 heuristics are rated for relevance by 3 evaluators. Weak inter-rater reliability is calculated with Krippendorff's Alpha of 0.343, refuting validation of any of the available heuristics. This weak reliability is due to the high complexity of video games, resulting in evaluators interpreting different reasonable causes and solutions for the issues, and hence the wide variance in their ratings of the heuristics.	heuristic evaluation; usability; user experience; video game	Gareth R.

970	GameSE_abstract	A practical implementation of a 3D game engine	Creating a 3D game engine is not a trivial task as gamers often demand for high quality output with top notch performance in games. In this paper, we show how various real-time rendering algorithms can be applied to implement a practical 3D game engine. We explore the general architecture of a 3D engine and discuss the role of a scene graph in a 3D engine. We look at scene graph from the software engineering perspective. In particular, we show the way to design a scene graph that is object-oriented and portable across different rendering engine. Then, we explain the algorithms that we apply to speed up the performance of our 3D engine. We optimize the 3D engine on the scene graph and object geometry levels. The algorithms that we propose are expected to perform reasonably well for both static and dynamic scenes. Finally, we give a brief preview on the possibility of parallel processing in scene graph to create a 3D engine with multiprocessing capability.

971	GameSE_abstract	The orchestrating firm: value creation in the video game industry	Purpose - The objective of this paper is to present an empirically founded outline of value creation and the orchestration of this process.Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative study of the video game industry was undertaken for which data were collected through use of both primary and secondary sources. The gathered data enabled a categorization of the industry, from both a user and a firm perspective, into different archetypical modes of value creation.Findings - The study adds to the understanding of value creation by illustrating that a firm can orchestrate the process through which value is created by being: an inspirator; a facilitator, and an attendant. In illustrating the continuity of this process, the paper introduces the orchestrating firm and the value emergence process.Research limitations/implications - In describing the modes through which interaction occurs within the video game industry, the paper provides an outline which can be used for further investigations of value creation. This industry holds, however, certain features making the arguments presented in need of further research.Practical implications - Based on the empirical findings, an outline is provided for the allocation and deployment of internal resources in order to enable continuous value creation.Originality/value - The paper empirically exemplifies how value creation is orchestrated by developing firms within the video game industry and illustrates value creation as a continuous process; a value emergence process.

972	GameSE_abstract	Collecting, organizing, and sharing pins in pinterest: interest-driven or social-driven?	Pinterest, a popular social curating service where people collect, organize, and share content (pins in Pinterest), has gained great attention in recent years. Despite the increasing interest in Pinterest, little research has paid attention to how people collect, manage, and share pins in Pinterest. In this paper, to shed insight on such issues, we study the following questions. How do people collect and manage pins by their tastes in Pinterest? What factors do mainly drive people to share their pins in Pinterest? How do the characteristics of users (e.g., gender, popularity, country) or properties of pins (e.g., category, topic) play roles in propagating pins in Pinterest? To answer these questions, we have conducted a measurement study on patterns of pin curating and sharing in Pinterest. By keeping track of all the newly posted and shared pins in each category (e.g., animal, kids, women's fashion) from June 5 to July 18, 2013, we built 350 K pin propagation trees for 3 M users. With the dataset, we investigate: (1) how users collect and curate pins, (2) how users share their pins and why, and (3) how users are related by shared pins of interest. Our key finding is that pin propagation in Pinterest is mostly driven by pin's properties like its topic, not by user's characteristics like her number of followers. We further show that users in the same community in the interest graph (i.e., representing the relations among users) of Pinterest share pins (i) in the same category with 94\% probability and (ii) of the same URL where pins come from with 89\% probability. Finally, we explore the implications of our findings for predicting how pins are shared in Pinterest.	social curating;  repin;  pinterest;  online social network;  content propagation	Han, Jinyoung; Choi, Daejin; Chun, Byung-Gon; Kwon, Ted; Kim, Hyun-chul; Choi, Yanghee	SIGMETRICS '14: The 2014 ACM international conference on Measurement and modeling of computer systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/2591971.2591996		15-27	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2591971.2591996,

We distinguish between (A) financial independence (constituted by the developer--investor relation), (B) creative independence (developer--intended audience) and (C) publishing independence (developer--publisher). Although the definition we propose is disjunctive, all of its three disjuncts (A, B and C) remain functionally similar (they all represent an independence from something). None of these disjuncts taken in isolation presents a necessary condition for game independence but the whole disjunction can be treated as such. Moreover, in a particular time period, the properties described above become highly correlated with a set of contingent properties (e.g. digital distribution, retro style or small team) determined by cultural, social, economic and technological circumstances of the video game culture of the era. As these contingent properties are oftentimes much easier to recognizeA (e.g. retro style) then the details of financial, creative and publishing situation of a game, they become heavily associated with independent games produced in a given time and place. We believe that the term oeindie game refers simply to a set of contingent properties-oeindie markers-correlated with a specific kind of independent games that has emerged around the mid-2000s in the Western world.

976	GameSE_abstract	Playing the post 9/11 on game service platforms: Premediation in The Division via Twitch.tv and Steam	This article focuses on the relation between post 9/11 imaginary and digital entertainment's audiences. Its aim is to enlighten potential players' perception of such an influence by exploring game service platforms - that is, online spaces with peculiar functions that are getting a foothold in the sector. By following the leading concepts of 'premediation' (Grusin, 2010) and 'platform' (Gillespie, 2010), an empirical investigation was directed about the game The Division, which glaringly exploits references to 9/11, in relation with Twitch.tv (live streaming) and Steam (multi-hub with several features, from user-generated content upload to discussion) environments. For the first 20 days from the release, multiple data were gathered daily (e.g. streaming chats, threads and artworks) and framed with a discourse/visual analysis (e.g. Gee, 2010). Results show that connections to 9/11 were perceived in experiencing game mechanics (e.g. multiplayer mode) rather than in discussing setting or plot. A preventive attitude against other players emerged as winning strategy and potential bridge to an 'interactive premediation' in media consumption.

977	GameSE_abstract	Advances in Game Accessibility from 2005 to 2010	The research in the area of game accessibility has grown significantly since the last time it was examined in 2005. This paper examines the body of work between 2005 and 2010. We selected a set of papers on topics we felt represented the scope of the field, but were not able to include all papers on the subject. A summary of the research we examined is provided, along with suggestions for future work in game accessibility. It is hoped that this summary will prompt others to perform further research in this area.	game; accessibility; disability; multimodality	Westin, Thomas; Bierre, Kevin; Gramenos, Dimitris; Hinn, Michelle	UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION: USERS DIVERSITY, PT 2	https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000302784900043		400-409			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2011	HCI (6) - Advances in game accessibility from 2005 to 2010	https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000302784900043	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLINHEIDELBERGER PLATZ	nan; References; Year; Bibtex
978	GameSE_abstract	Design of educational multiplayer videogames: A vision from collaborative learning	"Videogames and their specific devices can be used to improve learning process since they are very attractive for children. In this way, pupils increase their cognitive skills, the time dedicated to learn. their motivation for learning, their concentration and their attention while they are working/playing. The subject of ""learning by play"" is behind the introduction of recreational educational techniques in the classroom. If we also consider the increasing presence of new technologies in society in general and in classrooms in particular, we encounter a new way of teaching/learning. Moreover, several studies in the area of computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) have proved that learning in a group environment (both actively and interactively) is much more productive for pupils than traditional education.Our main objective is to reduce the complexity of introducing the collaborative learning techniques into development of educational videogames. So, in this paper we analyze the use of videogames as a particular case of new technologies in the classroom and we present a set of design guidelines to enable us to incorporate the features of collaborative learning in the videogame development process. We also explore how these guidelines affect the videogame architecture and how they can be applied when designing a videogame. As a practical example of using our proposal we have designed an educational videogame with group activities which aim is to learn the vowels."

979	GameSE_abstract	The structure of online diffusion networks	"Models of networked diffusion that are motivated by analogy with the spread of infectious disease have been applied to a wide range of social and economic adoption processes, including those related to new products, ideas, norms and behaviors. However, it is unknown how accurately these models account for the empirical structure of diffusion over networks. Here we describe the diffusion patterns arising from seven online domains, ranging from communications platforms to networked games to microblogging services, each involving distinct types of content and modes of sharing. We find strikingly similar patterns across all domains. In particular, the vast majority of cascades are small, and are described by a handful of simple tree structures that terminate within one degree of an initial adopting ""seed."" In addition we find that structures other than these account for only a tiny fraction of total adoptions; that is, adoptions resulting from chains of referrals are extremely rare. Finally, even for the largest cascades that we observe, we find that the bulk of adoptions often takes place within one degree of a few dominant individuals. Together, these observations suggest new directions for modeling of online adoption processes."

981	GameSE_abstract	Predicting the helpfulness of game reviews: A case study on the Steam store	Online user reviews play an important role in the assessment of product quality, and thus these reviews should be evaluated carefully. This study evaluates the helpfulness of game reviews on the online Steam store. It collects a large set of user reviews of different game genres and builds a classification model to predict whether these reviews are helpful or not. This model can accurately predict the helpfulness of the reviews based on different thresholds. This work also investigates various types of textual and word embedding features and analyzed their importance for predictions. Furthermore, it develops a regression-based model that can predict the score or rating of game reviews on Steam.

982	GameSE_abstract	Player experience:mixed methods and reporting results	The community of video game researchers has been rapidly evolving for the past few years, extending and modifying existing methodologies used by the HCI community to the environment of digital games. This one-day workshop investigates two areas that must be addressed to continue advancing the field: mixed method frameworks which integrate two or more techniques within a single study; and reporting as an integral part of the research process. The outcome of the workshop will be an archive of both the workshop submissions and the materials (posters and group productions). This will extend the discussion of topics beyond the workshop, and serve as a platform for future use and work. This one day workshop will bring together contributions from practitioners and academics in a yet untapped area of games user research.	game design; games user research; mixed method; player experience; software psychology; usability; user experience; video games	Veronica Zammitto; Pejman Mirza-Babaei; Ian Livingston; Marina Kobayashi; Lennart E.

983	GameSE_abstract	Real-time rule-based classification of player types in computer games	The power of using machine learning to improve or investigate the experience of play is only beginning to be realised. For instance, the experience of play is a psychological phenomenon, yet common psychological concepts such as the typology of temperaments have not been widely utilised in game design or research. An effective player typology provides a model by which we can analyse player behaviour. We present a real-time classifier of player type, implemented in the test-bed game Pac-Man. Decision Tree algorithms CART and C5.0 were trained on labels from the DGD player typology (Bateman and Boon, 21st century game design, vol. 1, 2005). The classifier is then built by selecting rules from the Decision Trees using a rule- performance metric, and experimentally validated. We achieve similar to 70% accuracy in this validation testing. We further analyse the concept descriptions learned by the Decision Trees. The algorithm output is examined with respect to a set of hypotheses on player behaviour. A set of open questions is then posed against the test data obtained from validation testing, to illustrate the further insights possible from extended analysis.

984	GameSE_abstract	Serious Games Usability Testing: How to Ensure Proper Usability, Playability, and Effectiveness	Usability testing is an important, yet often overlooked, aspect of serious game development. Issues in usability can drastically impact user experience and thus the learning outcomes associated with serious games. The goal of this paper is to provide serious game developers with an approach to efficiently and effectively apply usability testing into their development process. We propose a three-tiered approach to the assessment of game usability with the addition of assessments playability and learning to traditional usability. Learning or training is the main objective of a serious game and enjoyment is often required when trying to elicit the necessary usage to achieve this goal. Step-by-step procedures and associated measures are provided to assess usability, playability, and learning outcomes concurrently with game development, while taking into account the unique goals and limitations of time, personnel, and budget that small development companies often encounter.	usability; user experience; serious games	Olsen, Tanner; Procci, Katelyn; Bowers, Clint	DESIGN, USER EXPERIENCE, AND USABILITY: THEORY, METHODS, TOOLS AND PRACTICE, PT 2	https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000302791600070		625-634			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2011	HCI (10) - Serious Games Usability Testing: How to Ensure Proper Usability, Playability, and Effectiveness	https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000302791600070	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLINHEIDELBERGER PLATZ	nan; References; Year; Bibtex

986	GameSE_abstract	An Ontological Meta-Model for Game Research	The subfield of game ontology has seen many models and structural hierarchies, but few that actively build on each other, or even attempt comparisons. This paper introduces a meta-model, which in addition to being an ontological model of its own, also offers a method for comparison between competing or isolated models and concepts. It does so by treating games as mechanisms (Craver 2007) with multiple levels of description, and differentiates between four main layers of the game-mechanism. In the first part of the paper we present the model in detail. In the second part of the paper we show applications of the model - we present how some of the existing approaches to game ontology can be compared within it and how it can be used to describe two case examples: the ancient Egyptian funeral game Senet and the difference between game mechanics and game rules.

987	GameSE_abstract	Characterizing Conversation Patterns in Reddit: From the Perspectives of Content Properties and User Participation Behaviors	It becomes the norm for people to communicate with one another through various online social channels, where different conversation structures are formed depending on platforms. One of the common online communication patterns is a threaded conversation where a user brings up a conversation topic, and then other people respond to the initiator or other participants by commenting, which can be modeled as a tree structure. This paper seeks to investigate (i) the characteristics of online threaded conversations in terms of volume, responsiveness, and virality and (ii) what and how content properties and user participation behaviors are associated with such characteristics. To this end, we collect 700~K threaded conversations from 1.5~M users in Reddit, one of the most popular online communities allowing people to communicate with others in the form of threaded conversations. Using the collected dataset, we find that `social' words, difficulties of texts, and document relevancy are associated with the volume, responsiveness, and virality of conversations. We also discover that large, viral conversations are mostly formed by a small portion of users who are reciprocally communicate with others by analyzing user interactions. Our analysis on discovering user roles in conversations reveal that users who are interested in multiple topics play important roles in large and viral conversations, whereas heavy posting users play important roles in responsive conversations. We expand our analysis to topical communities (i.e., subreddits) and find that news-related, image-based, and discussion-related communities are more likely to have large, responsive, and viral conversations, respectively.	virality;  user behavior;  threaded conversation;  subreddits;  reddit;  online communication;  comment	Choi, Daejin; Han, Jinyoung; Chung, Taejoong; Ahn, Yong-Yeol; Chun, Byung-Gon; Kwon, Ted Taekyoung	COSN '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM on Conference on Online Social Networks	https://doi.org/10.1145/2817946.2817959		233-243	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2817946.2817959,

988	GameSE_abstract	Beta Testing in Social Work	The field of social work does not currently have a widely adopted method for expediting innovations into micro- or macropractice. Although it is common in fields such as engineering and business to have formal processes for accelerating scientific advances into consumer markets, few comparable mechanisms exist in the social sciences or social services. Given that beta testing is successfully used to scale innovation in business and engineering, why is there no method for beta testing in social work? Could this be the reason that innovations in social work practice remain decades behind scientific research findings? This article explores reasons for the scarcity of options for scaling innovation in the field of social work and proposes a method for shortening development cycles for social work innovations to ensure that advances reach consumers--and ultimately improve their lives--more quickly.	consumer; human; market; model; social work practice	Traube, Dorian E.; Begun, Stephanie; Petering, Robin; Flynn, Marilyn L.

989	GameSE_abstract	Digital Games, the Aftermath: Qualitative Insights into Postgame Experiences	To date, most research on user experiences in digital games has focused on what happens during game play. In this chapter, we conceptualize the phenomenon of postgame experiences, that is, experiences gamers have once they stopped playing. We propose and tackle two types of postgame experiences: short-term postgame experiences that arise immediately after game play and long-term postgame experiences that occur after repeatedly and intensively playing a particular game or game genre. We present two focus group studies that offered qualitative insights into which postgame experiences are at play, to what extent, and under which conditions. The chapter concludes with a discussion and recommendations for future research.

990	GameSE_abstract	Paratext: The in-between of structure and play	This chapter examines paratext as an active element within video games. Paratext, as taken from Gerard Genette's works has often been cited within the context of video games, but not examined in detail. Current scholarship focuses on epitext, but not peritext, which is Genette's primary focus. Mia Consalvo and Peter Lunenfeld's work discuss the epitextual importance of paratext within video games, with only a hint towards the importance of peritext. Through a brief exploration of paratext's history in both literature and games, this chapter will reveal a need for deeper analysis within video game studies. Focusing on in-game, in-system and in-world types of paratexts this paper will attempt to formalise the unaddressed issue of paratext in video games.

992	GameSE_abstract	Modelling user experience - An agenda for research and practice	Several issues related to measurement and structural models of user experience (UX) are addressed by five papers published in the special issue of Interacting with Computers. The five papers that are published in the journal specifically focus on modeling UX. A basic illustration of UX modeling is presented using a simple and simplified model of UX to initiate a detailed discussion of issues for research and practice. The main UX constructs include a user's perceived hedonic quality, pragmatic quality, and beauty and goodness. The measurement model represents these four constructs as latent variables that are measured using manifest variables. It allows latent variables to be correlated, while the structural model states the cause-and-effect relations between UX constructs as latent and other variables. It is expected that a balanced focus on these two types of measure will help improve UX and performance.

994	GameSE_abstract	How does it play better? exploring user testing and biometric storyboards in games user research	Improving game design is a hard task. Few methods are available in games user research (GUR) to test formally how game designs work for players. In particular, the usefulness of user tests (UTs) for game designers has not been fully studied in the CHI community. We propose a novel GUR method called Biometric Storyboards (BioSt) and present a study demonstrating how a Classic UT and a BioSt UT both help designers create a better gameplay experience. In addition, we show that BioSt can help designers deliver significantly better visuals, more fun, and higher gameplay quality than designing without UTs and that classic UTs do not provide this significant advantage. Our interviews support the idea that BioSt provides more nuanced game design improvement. The design implication is that a game designed with the BioSt method will result in high gameplay quality.	games;  games user research;  physiological measures;  storyboards;  user experience;  user testing;  visualization	Mirza-Babaei, Pejman; Nacke, Lennart E.; Gregory, John; Collins, Nick; Fitzpatrick, Geraldine	CHI '13: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2466200		1499-1508	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2470654.2466200,

    abstract = ""Improving game design is a hard task. Few methods are available in games user research (GUR) to test formally how game designs work for players. In particular, the usefulness of user tests (UTs) for game designers has not been fully studied in the CHI community. We propose a novel GUR method called Biometric Storyboards (BioSt) and present a study demonstrating how a Classic UT and a BioSt UT both help designers create a better gameplay experience. In addition, we show that BioSt can help designers deliver significantly better visuals, more fun, and higher gameplay quality than designing without UTs and that classic UTs do not provide this significant advantage. Our interviews support the idea that BioSt provides more nuanced game design improvement. The design implication is that a game designed with the BioSt method will result in high gameplay quality."",

995	GameSE_abstract	A Companion to New Media Dynamics - The politics of ‘platforms’	Online content providers such as YouTube are carefully positioning themselves to users, clients, advertisers and policymakers, making strategic claims for what they do and do not do, and how their place in the information landscape should be understood. One term in particular, ‘platform’, reveals the contours of this discursive work. The term has been deployed in both their populist appeals and their marketing pitches, sometimes as technical ‘platforms’, sometimes as ‘platforms’ from which to speak, sometimes as ‘platforms’ of opportunity. Whatever tensions exist in serving all of these constituencies are carefully elided. The term also fits their efforts to shape information policy, where they seek protection for facilitating user expression, yet also seek limited liability for what those users say. As these providers become the curators of public discourse, we must examine the roles they aim to play, and the terms by which they hope to be judged.

996	GameSE_abstract	Learning to perform moderation in online forums	Online discussion forums are a valuable resource for people looking to find information, discuss ideas, and get advice on the Internet. Unfortunately, many forums have too much activity and information available, resulting in information overload. Moderation systems are implemented in some forums as a way to handle this problem, but due to sparsity issues, they are often not sufficient. We describe a novel method for learning from past moderations to develop a classifier that can perform automated moderation and thus address the sparsity problem. Additionally, we discuss the possibility of training a moderating classifier on a moderated forum and then applying it to an otherwise unmoderated forum.

997	GameSE_abstract	Intergenerational context as an emphasis for design	As populations age across the developed world [18], attention is turning to ways of preserving the quality of life for the growing number of people experiencing an extended old age [22]. Information and communication technologies have great potential for supporting older people to maintain their independence and standard of living [2]. Attempts to make computer-based technologies more accessible to older users have mostly adopted functional approaches, redesigning or adapting user interfaces to reconcile human changes to physical and cognitive abilities [17]. Whilst this approach towards functional accessibility is important and significant in its own right, it struggles to address some of the contextual issues that underlie the meaningful and socially embedded use of such technologies [9]. Contextual issues can undermine the usefulness of functional accessibility when, for example, older people choose not to adopt information and communication technologies at all, seeing them as irrelevant [14] or offering no benefits [11, 16] to their social context. In this special issue, we consider universal access in relation to the inclusion of older people and explore the accessibility of computer-based technologies in its broadest sense, emphasising the social and motivational aspects of use rather than the functional concerns at the interface. The papers explore notions of accessibility, not only from the perspective of redesigning existing technologies to improve access but also investigating the purposeful creation of technology to best meet broader needs and aspirations. In addition to extending ideas of accessibility, the papers also broaden the way older people are typically considered in age-related research. Rather than being characterised as frail and impaired, older people in these papers are active and engaged, seeking opportunities for interactions with the wider community. Specifically, the papers focus on the importance of the intergenerational context as an emphasis for the design of innovative technologies.

A hostile external Red Team developed ten code injection exploits and used these exploits to repeatedly attack an application protected by ClearView. ClearView detected and blocked all of the attacks. For seven of the ten exploits, ClearView automatically generated patches that corrected the error, enabling the application to survive the attacks and continue on to successfully process subsequent inputs. Finally, the Red Team attempted to make Clear-View apply an undesirable patch, but ClearView's patch evaluation mechanism enabled ClearView to identify and discard both ineffective patches and damaging patches.	self healing	Perkins, Jeff H.; Kim, Sunghun; Larsen, Sam; Amarasinghe, Saman; Bachrach, Jonathan; Carbin, Michael; Pacheco, Carlos; Sherwood, Frank; Sidiroglou, Stelios; Sullivan, Greg; Wong, Weng-Fai; Zibin, Yoav; Ernst, Michael D.; Rinard, Martin	SOSP '09: Proceedings of the ACM SIGOPS 22nd symposium on Operating systems principles	https://doi.org/10.1145/1629575.1629585		87-102	"@inproceedings{10.1145/1629575.1629585,

999	GameSE_abstract	Game accessibility: a survey	Over the last three decades, video games have evolved from a pastime into a force of change that is transforming the way people perceive, learn about, and interact with the world around them. In addition to entertainment, games are increasingly used for other purposes such as education or health. Despite this increased interest, a significant number of people encounter barriers when playing games due to a disability. Accessibility problems may include the following: (1) not being able to receive feedback; (2) not being able to determine in-game responses; (3) not being able to provide input using conventional input devices. This paper surveys the current state-of-the-art in research and practice in the accessibility of video games and points out relevant areas for future research. A generalized game interaction model shows how a disability affects ones ability to play games. Estimates are provided on the total number of people in the United States whose ability to play games is affected by a disability. A large number of accessible games are surveyed for different types of impairments, across several game genres, from which a number of high-and low-level accessibility strategies are distilled for game developers to inform their design.

1000	GameSE_abstract	Modeling the efficacy of persuasive strategies for different gamer types in serious games for health	Persuasive games for health are designed to alter human behavior or attitude using various Persuasive Technology (PT) strategies. Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of such games, which treat players as a monolithic group by adopting a one-size-fits-all design approach. Studies of gameplay motivation have shown that this is a bad approach because a motivational approach that works for one individual may actually demotivate behavior in others. In an attempt to resolve this weakness, we conducted a large-scale study on 1,108 gamers to examine the persuasiveness of ten PT strategies that are commonly employed in persuasive game design, and the receptiveness of seven gamer personalities (gamer types identified by BrianHex) to the ten PT strategies. We developed models showing the receptiveness of the gamer types to the PT strategies and created persuasive profiles, which are lists of strategies that can be employed to motivate behavior for each gamer type. We then explored the differences between the models and, based on the results, proposed two approaches for data-driven persuasive game design. The first is the one-size-fits-all approach that will motivate a majority of gamers, while not demotivating any player. The second is the personalized approach that will best persuade a particular type of gamer. We also compiled a list of the best and the worst strategies for each gamer type. Finally, to bridge the gap between game design and PT researchers, we map common game mechanics to the persuasive system design strategies.

1001	GameSE_abstract	The role of social networks in information diffusion	Online social networking technologies enable individuals to simultaneously share information with any number of peers. Quantifying the causal effect of these mediums on the dissemination of information requires not only identification of who inuences whom, but also of whether individuals would still propagate information in the absence of social signals about that information. We examine the role of social networks in online information diffusion with a large-scale field experiment that randomizes exposure to signals about friends'information sharing among 253 million subjects in situ. Those who are exposed are significantly more likely to spread information, and do so sooner than those who are not exposed. We further examine the relative role of strong and weak ties in information propagation. We show that, although stronger ties are individually more inuential, it is the more abundant weak ties who are responsible for the propagation of novel information. This suggests that weak ties may play a more dominant role in the dissemination of information online than currently believed.

1002	GameSE_abstract	Biofeedback game design:using direct and indirect physiological control to enhance game interaction	Prior work on physiological game interaction has focused on dynamically adapting games using physiological sensors. In this paper, we propose a classification of direct and indirect physiological sensor input toaugmenttraditional game control. To find out which sensors work best for which game mechanics, we conducted a mixed-methods study using different sensor mappings. Our results show participants have a preference for direct physiological control in games. This has two major design implications for physiologically controlled games: (1) Direct physiological sensors should be mapped intuitively to reflect an action in the virtual world; (2) Indirect physiological input is best used as a dramatic device in games to influence features altering the game world.	affective computing; affective gaming; biofeedback; entertainment; games; physiological input; psychophysiology	Lennart Erik Nacke; Michael Kalyn; Calvin Lough; Regan Lee Mandryk	CHI '11: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/1978942.1978958		103-112			Excluded	snowballing			2	ACM	2011	CHI - Biofeedback game design: using direct and indirect physiological control to enhance game interaction	https://doi.org/10.1145/1978942.1978958	Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
1003	GameSE_abstract	Evaluating user experience of adaptive digital educational games with Activity Theory	Adaptive digital educational games (DEGs) providing players with relevant interventions can enhance gameplay experience. This advance in game design, however, renders the user experience (UX) evaluation of DEGs even more challenging. To tackle this challenge, we developed a four-dimension evaluation framework (i.e., gaming experience, learning experience, adaptivity, and usability) and applied it to an empirical study with a DEG on teaching geography. Mixed-method approaches were adopted to collect data with 16 boys aged 10-11. Specifically, a so-called Dyadic User Experience Tests (DUxT) was employed; participants were paired up to assume different roles during gameplay. Learning efficacy was evaluated with a pre-post intervention measurement using a domain-specific questionnaire. Learning experience, gaming experiences and usability were evaluated with intensive in situ observations and interviews guided by a multidimensional scheme; content analysis of these transcribed audio data was supplemented by video analysis. Effectiveness of adaptivity algorithms was planned to be evaluated with automatic logfiles, which, unfortunately, could not be realised due to some technical problem. Nonetheless, the user-based data could offer some insights into this issue. Furthermore, we attempted to bridge the existing gap in UX research the lack of theoretical frameworks in understanding user experience by adopting Engestrom's (1 987) extended framework of Activity Theory (AT) that provides contextual information essential for understanding contradictions and breakdowns observed in the interactions between the game players. The dyadic gameplay setting allows us to explore the issue of group UX. Implications for further applications of the AT framework in the UX research, especially the interplay between evaluation and redesign (i.e., downstream utility of UX evaluation methods), are discussed.

1004	GameSE_abstract	Enclosures at play: Surveillance in the code and culture of videogames	By analyzing the software used on Microsoft’s Xbox 360 to monitor and track player’s behavior in videogames, this paper demonstrates that the platform has appropriated elements of visibility related to the code and culture of videogames to create a surveillant videogame console. Analyzing elements common to the code of videogames we can understand that certain components of games have always relied on surveillant elements which facilitate interactive play. Similarly the early history of videogames in arcades has afforded a culture of visibility to videogames which has persisted in their design at the level of code. This paper demonstrates how these sociotechnical artifacts common to videogames have been deployed in systems of datamining, tracking and play on the Xbox 360 and in doing so, offers perspectives for critiquing these systems.

1005	GameSE_abstract	Console gaming across generations: exploring intergenerational interactions in collocated console gaming	In this paper, we examine the intergenerational gaming practices of four generations of console gamers, from ages 3 to 83 and, in particular, the roles that gamers of different generations take on when playing together in groups. Our data highlight the extent to which existing gaming technologies support interactions within collocated intergenerational groups, and our analysis reveals a more generationally flexible suite of roles in these computer-mediated interactions than have been documented by previous studies of more traditional collocated, intergenerational interactions. Finally, we offer implications for game designers who wish to make console games more accessible to intergenerational groups.

1008	GameSE_abstract	Exploring perceptions toward biometric technology in service encounters: a comparison of current users and potential adopters	Biometrics is a new technology that authenticates an individual's identity via his or her unique physical or behavioural characteristics, such as the iris, fingerprints, hand geometry, voice and signature. Although its application is becoming pervasive in the public and private sectors due to the potential benefits of the technology, its adoption by end-users is progressing slowly. This study investigates multiple aspects of the benefits and risks that consumers perceive in using biometric technology. A survey was conducted by contacting the actual customers of an American bank that has utilised fingerprint technology at its ATMs. The proposed model was tested with current users as well as potential adopters of the target technology. We found that enjoyment was the most salient perceived benefit for using fingerprint ATMs for both current users and potential adopters. Banks thus may highlight intrinsic values, such as the novelty of biometrics, to motivate the use of the technology. However, to promote potential users' adoption decisions, banks need to educate them about the security benefits of financial transactions under the technology. The result also showed that the current users were highly concerned about information privacy risk in using the fingerprint ATMs. Therefore, banks are advised to develop internal policies to protect personal biometric data from any identity theft or illegal uses to encourage continuous usage by the current users.	technology adoption behaviour; fingerprint recognition technology; biometrics; group comparison; fingerprint ATMs	Byun, Sookeun; Byun, Sang-Eun	BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY	https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2011.553741		217-230			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2013	Exploring perceptions toward biometric technology in service encounters: a comparison of current users and potential adopters	https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2011.553741	TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
1009	GameSE_abstract	Games User Research (GUR) for Indie Studios	Playtesting sessions are becoming more integrated in game development cycles. However, playtests are not always feasible or affordable for smaller independent game studios, as they require specialized equipment and expertise. Given the recent growth and prevalence of independent developers, there is a need to adapt playtesting processes for indie studios to assist in creating an optimal player experience. Therefore, our research focuses on challenges and opportunities of integrating games user research in the development cycles of independent studios. We worked with three studios conducting playtests on their upcoming titles. In line with the CHI2016 #chi4good spirit this paper contributes to the important topic of adopting user research methods for indie and small game studios. We believe that the games user research (GUR) field must advance towards demographics that will benefit from GUR but are under-represented in the community and this paper is one of the first that will contribute to this.	games user research; indie development; persona; playtest; rapid prototyping; telemetry	Naeem Moosajee; Pejman Mirza-Babaei	CHI EA '16: Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/2851581.2892408		3159-3165			Excluded	snowballing			2	ACM	2016	CHI Extended Abstracts - Games User Research (GUR) for Indie Studios	https://doi.org/10.1145/2851581.2892408	Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
1010	GameSE_abstract	Can cascades be predicted?	On many social networking web sites such as Facebook and Twitter, resharing or reposting functionality allows users to share others' content with their own friends or followers. As content is reshared from user to user, large cascades of reshares can form. While a growing body of research has focused on analyzing and characterizing such cascades, a recent, parallel line of work has argued that the future trajectory of a cascade may be inherently unpredictable. In this work, we develop a framework for addressing cascade prediction problems. On a large sample of photo reshare cascades on Facebook, we find strong performance in predicting whether a cascade will continue to grow in the future. We find that the relative growth of a cascade becomes more predictable as we observe more of its reshares, that temporal and structural features are key predictors of cascade size, and that initially, breadth, rather than depth in a cascade is a better indicator of larger cascades. This prediction performance is robust in the sense that multiple distinct classes of features all achieve similar performance. We also discover that temporal features are predictive of a cascade's eventual shape. Observing independent cascades of the same content, we find that while these cascades differ greatly in size, we are still able to predict which ends up the largest.	cascade prediction;  contagion;  information diffusion	Cheng, Justin; Adamic, Lada; Dow, P.

In this context, usability plays a fundamental role in the process of developing successful Web sites. In this article we review different definitions about the discipline of usability, its incorporation in the engineering process (usability engineering) and its relation to software engineer, as well as its attributes and evaluation methods. The considerations about the evaluation system of the Web usability are also presented, advising the user and basing it in the establishment of critical tasks (SIRIUS, reviewed by the authors).

1012	GameSE_abstract	Influencing Experience: The Effects of Reading Game Reviews on Player Experience	Game reviews are used by game developers for making business decisions and measuring the success of a title, and have been shown to affect player perception of game quality. We conducted a study where players read positive or negative reviews of a game before playing, and show that the valence of review text affected game ratings and that these differences could not be explained by mediating changes in mood. Although we show predictable changes in player experience over the course of the study (measured objectively through physiological sensors), there were no objective differences in experience depending on review valence. Our results suggest that reading reviews does not directly affect play experience, but rather is a post-play cognitive rationalization of the experience with the content of the review. Our results are important for understanding player experience and to the game industry where reviews and user forums affect a game's commercial success.

1013	GameSE_abstract	(A)Social reputation: Exploring the relationship between online video game involvement and social competence	Affordable and accessible Internet has changed the way video games are played, allowing individuals to connect worldwide in shared gaming spaces. On the surface participation within these environments may seem socially beneficial, as these highly social, playful spaces allow players to connect, interact with, and learn from others. However, there is a growing concern that increased participation within online gaming environments comes with a wide variety of social consequences, contributing to numerous losses in 'offline' sociability. While considerable research has examined these claims, consistent relationships between social competence and online video game involvement have yet to be established. The current work (N = 515) aimed to examine the extent to which online video game involvement may support, or undermine, the development and maintenance of traditional social skills. The results indicate that there are unique relationships between social skills and video game involvement within online gaming populations. However, among online video game players, these links were not as negative or broad as hypothesized. The results of this assessment dispute the anecdotal attribution of a global level of social ineptitude amongst online video game players and provide insight into the potential effects of online video game play on skill development and maintenance.

1015	GameSE_abstract	Further study of Glass GEM	We recently developed a Glass GEM (G-GEM), and it exhibited a superior performance. We also developed a G-GEM with a single-sided guard ring structure, in order to improve its spark tolerance. The guard ring G-GEM also showed good performance. The gas gain reached 7,500 with a single G-GEM setup. Energy resolution was 17.3% at maximum, with the collimated 6 keV X-ray source. Nowadays, large-area micro pattern gaseous detectors are required not only in physics field, but also in medical application or neutron detection application. Therefore, we are currently developing a large-area G-GEM. In this research, we will show the results of the preliminary experiments with it. Gas gain reached up to around 1000. The energy resolution was 33.6% at gain ~1,000.

1016	GameSE_abstract	Linguistic Analysis of Toxic Behavior in an Online Video Game	In this paper we explore thelinguisticcomponents of toxic behavior by using crowdsourced data from over 590 thousand cases of accused toxic players in a popular match-based competition game, League of Legends. We perform a series of linguistic analyses to gain a deeper understanding of the role communication plays in the expression of toxic behavior. We characterize linguistic behavior of toxic players and compare it with that of typical players in an online competition game.

1017	GameSE_abstract	The influence of product aesthetics and user state in usability testing	An empirical study examined the effects of two influencing factors in usability tests on user performance and usability ratings. Product aesthetics (high vs. low) as the main independent factor and prior usage event (positive vs. negative) as a subsidiary independent factor were varied in a between-participants design. 60 participants took part in the experiment, completing a number of typical tasks of mobile phone users. The results showed that increased product aesthetics had a positive effect on perceived usability and led to longer task completion times. After a negative usage event had been experimentally induced, usability ratings dropped as expected but user performance on subsequent tasks remained unaffected. An important implication of the study is that the aesthetic properties of a product may have multiple effects that go beyond perceived product attractiveness.	usability test; product aesthetics; perceived usability; user performance; product attractiveness	Sauer, Juergen; Sonderegger, Andreas	BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY	https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2010.503352		787-796			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2011	The Influence of Product Aesthetics and User State in Usability Testing	https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2010.503352	TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

1019	GameSE_abstract	Digital Games, the Aftermath: Qualitative Insights into Postgame Experiences	To date, most research on user experiences in digital games has focused on what happens during game play. In this chapter, we conceptualize the phenomenon of postgame experiences, that is, experiences gamers have once they stopped playing. We propose and tackle two types of postgame experiences: short-term postgame experiences that arise immediately after game play and long-term postgame experiences that occur after repeatedly and intensively playing a particular game or game genre. We present two focus group studies that offered qualitative insights into which postgame experiences are at play, to what extent, and under which conditions. The chapter concludes with a discussion and recommendations for future research.

1020	GameSE_abstract	Play-Personas: Behaviours and Belief Systems in User-Centred Game Design	Game designers attempt to ignite affective, emotional responses from players via engineering game designs to incite definite user experiences. Theories of emotion state that definite emotional responses are individual, and caused by the individual interaction sequence or history. Engendering desired emotions in the audience of traditional audiovisual media is a considerable challenge; however it is potentially even more difficult to achieve the same goal for the audience of interactive entertainment, because a substantial degree of control rests in the hand of the end user rather than the designer. This paper presents a possible solution to the challenge of integrating the user in the design of interactive entertainment such as computer games by employing the ``persona'' framework introduced by Alan Cooper. This approach is already in use in interaction design. The method can be improved by complementing the traditional narrative description of personas with quantitative, data-oriented models of predicted patterns of user behaviour for a specific computer game Additionally, persona constructs can be applied both as design-oriented metaphors during the development of games, and as analytical lenses to existing games, e.g. for evaluation of patterns of player behaviour.

1021	GameSE_abstract	Beyond Biometrics	Throughout the last 40 years, the essence of automated identification of users has remained the same. In this article, a new class of biometrics is proposed that is founded on processing biosignals, as opposed to images. After a brief introduction on biometrics, biosignals are discussed, including their advantages, disadvantages, and guidelines for obtaining them. This new class of biometrics increases biometrics' robustness and enables cross validation. Next, biosignals' use is illustrated by two biosignal-based biometrics: voice identification and handwriting recognition. Additionally, the concept of a digital human model is introduced. Last, some issues will be touched upon that will arise when biosignal- based biometrics are brought to practice.	biometrics; biosignal processing; digital human model; validation; robustness	van den Broek, Egon L.

1022	GameSE_abstract	Pareto Solutions vs Dataset Optima: Concepts and Methods for Optimizing Competing Objectives with Constraints in Retrieval	"When ranking search results for multiple objectives, such as maximizing the relevance and diversity of retrieved documents, competing objectives can induce a space of optimal solutions, each reflecting a different optimal trade-off over objectives. This raises several important questions. Firstly, what Pareto optimal solution set is induced by objective functions? Secondly, what are the best solutions achievable on a given dataset? Finally, how closely do the best dataset solutions approach the true Pareto optimal? We present a clear conceptual framing of these questions, with supporting terminology and visualizations, distinguishing Pareto vs. ""dataset-best"" solutions and providing strong intuition about how and why different optimization problems lead to different shapes and forms of solutions (regardless of optimization technique).

1023	GameSE_abstract	Manipulation of online reviews: An analysis of ratings, readability, and sentiments	As consumers become increasingly reliant on online reviews to make purchase decisions, the sales of the product becomes dependent on the word of mouth (WOM) that it generates. As a result, there can be attempts by firms to manipulate online reviews of products to increase their sales. Despite the suspicion on the existence of such manipulation, the amount of such manipulation is unknown, and deciding which reviews to believe in is largely based on the reader's discretion and intuition. Therefore, the success of the manipulation of reviews by firms in generating sales of products is unknown. In this paper, we propose a simple statistical method to detect online reviews manipulation, and assess how consumers respond to products with manipulated reviews. In particular, the writing style of reviewers is examined, and the effectiveness of manipulation through ratings, sentiments, and readability is investigated. Our analysis examines textual information available in online reviews by combining sentiment mining techniques with readability assessments. We discover that around 10.3% of the products are subject to online reviews manipulation. In spite of the deliberate use of sentiments and ratings in manipulated products, consumers are only able to detect manipulation taking place through ratings, but not through sentiments. The findings from this research ensue a note of caution for all consumers that rely on online reviews of books for making purchases, and encourage them to delve deep into the book reviews without being deceived by fraudulent manipulation.

1024	GameSE_abstract	Jumping the Gap: Indie Labour and the Imagined Indie Community	Due to the recent proliferation of free-to-use, professional-quality development tools, crowdsourced fundraising, and the ascendency of digital distribution platforms, i? 1/2indiei? 1/2 digital game developers are emerging on an unprecedented scale. Based on ethnographic research conducted at indie accelerator Execution Labs from January to June of 2015, this thesis explores how indie developers frame risk, creativity, success, and failure in relation to the communities they are a part of. The first three chapters highlight useful concepts from Gina Neffi? 1/2s i? 1/2Venture Labouri? 1/2 (2012), describe Execution Labs from the researcheri? 1/2s perspective, and detail the researcheri? 1/2s approach to collaborative embedded ethnography, respectively. The fourth chapter is dedicated to two related purposes: the first part will posit that communities of indie developers and indie fans share a common creative discourse, and thus constitute what Benedict Anderson has termed an i? 1/2Imagined Communityi? 1/2 (2006). The latter portion of the chapter will explore how Newgrounds.com facilitated discourses about digital games and Macromedia Flash, and how the resultant imagined communities have influenced contemporary indie identity and development practice. The final chapter opens by proposing a definition of i? 1/2indie labouri? 1/2: a creative, communitarian strategy with which indie developers manage the risks they face. It will then consider the stories of those who performed indie labour as part of Execution Labs. This thesis will conclude by ruminating on potential future avenues of study and ongoing issues that hinder indie developmenti? 1/2s potential as an open and accessible praxis.	nan	Browne, Pierson	Communication Studies	https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/980737/	nan	nan	nan		Excluded	snowballing			2	GoogleScholar	2015	Jumping the Gap: Indie Labour and the Imagined Indie Community	https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/980737/	Concordia University	
1025	GameSE_abstract	Exploring the user experience of three-dimensional virtual learning environments	This study examines the users' experiences with three-dimensional (3D) virtual environments to investigate the areas of development as a learning application. For the investigation, the modified technology acceptance model (TAM) is used with constructs from expectation-confirmation theory (ECT). Users' responses to questions about cognitive perceptions and continuous use were collected and analysed with factors that were modified from TAM and ECT. Whilst the findings confirm the significant roles by users' cognitive perceptions, the findings also shed light on the possibility of 3D application serving as an enabler of learning tools. In the extended model, the moderating effects of confirmation/satisfaction and demographics of the relationships amongst the variables were found to be significant.	immersion; presence; 3D; virtual environment; learning system	Shin, Dong-Hee; Biocca, Frank; Choo, Hyunseung	BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY	https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2011.606334		203-214			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2013	Exploring the user experience of three-dimensional virtual learning environments	https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2011.606334	TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
1026	GameSE_abstract	Biometric storyboards: a games user research approach for improving qualitative evaluations of player experience	Developing video games is an iterative and demanding process. It is difficult to achieve the goal of most video games i? 1/2 to be enjoyable, engaging and to create revenue for game developers i? 1/2 because of many hard-to-evaluate factors, such as the different ways players can interact with the game. Understanding how players behave during gameplay is of vital importance to developers and can be uncovered in user tests as part of game development. This can help developers to identify and resolve any potential problem areas before release, leading to a better player experience and possibly higher game review scores and sales. However, traditional user testing methods were developed for function and efficiency oriented applications. Hence, many traditional user testing methods cannot be applied in the same way for video game evaluation. This thesis presents an investigation into the contributions of physiological measurements in user testing within games user research (GUR). GUR specifically studies the interaction between a game and users (players) with the aim to provide feedback for developers to help them to optimise the game design of their title. An evaluation technique called Biometric Storyboards is developed, which visualises the relationships between game events, player feedback and changes in a playeri? 1/2s physiological state. Biometric Storyboards contributes to the field of human-computer interaction and GUR in three important areas: (1) visualising mixedmeasures of player experience, (2) deconstructing game design by analysing game events and pace, (3) incremental improvement of classic user research techniques (such as interviews and physiological measurements). These contributions are described in practical case studies, interviews with game developers and laboratory experiments. The results show this evaluation approach can enable games user researchers to increase the plausibility and persuasiveness of their reports and facilitate developers to better deliver their design goals. Biometric Storyboards is not aimed at replacing existing methods, but to extend them with mixed methods visualisations, to provide powerful tools for games user researchers and developers to better understand and communicate player needs, interactions and experiences. The contributions of this thesis are directly applicable for user researchers and game developers, as well as for researchers in user experience evaluation in entertainment systems.	nan	Mirza-Babaei, Pejman	nan	https://sussex.figshare.com/articles/thesis/Biometric_storyboards_a_games_user_research_approach_for_improving_qualitative_evaluations_of_player_experience/23401361?file=41126138	nan	168	nan		Excluded	snowballing			2	GoogleScholar	2014	Biometric storyboards : a games user research approach for improving qualitative evaluations of player experience	https://sussex.figshare.com/articles/thesis/Biometric_storyboards_a_games_user_research_approach_for_improving_qualitative_evaluations_of_player_experience/23401361?file=41126138	University of Sussex

1031	GameSE_abstract	Deep shading buffers on commodity GPUs	Real-time rendering with true motion and defocus blur remains an elusive goal for application developers. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in the areas of rasterization, shading, and reconstruction for stochastic rendering. However, we have yet to see an efficient method for decoupled sampling that can be implemented on current or near-future graphics processors. In this paper, we propose one such algorithm that leverages the capability of modern GPUs to perform unordered memory accesses from within shaders. Our algorithm builds per-pixel primitive lists in canonical shading space. All shading then takes place in a single, non-multisampled forward rendering pass using conservative rasterization. This pass exploits the rasterization and shading hardware to perform shading very efficiently, and only samples that are visible in the final image are shaded. Last, the shading samples are gathered and filtered to create the final image. The input to our algorithm can be generated using a variety of methods, of which we show examples of interactive stochastic and interleaved rasterization, as well as ray tracing.	computer graphics; conservative rasterization; decoupled sampling; pixel shading; stochastic rasterization	Petrik Clarberg; Jacob Munkberg	ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)	https://doi.org/10.1145/2661229.2661245					Excluded	snowballing			2	ACM	2014	Deep shading buffers on commodity GPUs	https://doi.org/10.1145/2661229.2661245	Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Pages; Year; Bibtex; Link

1033	GameSE_abstract	Terra: a multi-stage language for high-performance computing	High-performance computing applications, such as auto-tuners and domain-specific languages, rely on generative programming techniques to achieve high performance and portability. However, these systems are often implemented in multiple disparate languages and perform code generation in a separate process from program execution, making certain optimizations difficult to engineer. We leverage a popular scripting language, Lua, to stage the execution of a novel low-level language, Terra. Users can implement optimizations in the high-level language, and use built-in constructs to generate and execute high-performance Terra code. To simplify meta-programming, Lua and Terra share the same lexical environment, but, to ensure performance, Terra code can execute independently of Lua's runtime. We evaluate our design by reimplementing existing multi-language systems entirely in Terra. Our Terra-based auto-tuner for BLAS routines performs within 20\% of ATLAS, and our DSL for stencil computations runs 2.3x faster than hand-written C.	dsl;  lua;  staged computation	DeVito, Zachary; Hegarty, James; Aiken, Alex; Hanrahan, Pat; Vitek, Jan	PLDI '13: Proceedings of the 34th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation	https://doi.org/10.1145/2491956.2462166		105-116	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2491956.2462166,

1034	GameSE_abstract	How to Measure the Game Experience?:Analysis of the Factor Structure of Two Questionnaires	We describe and report the analysis of two widely used questionnaires to measure the player experience in digital games. In order to contribute to the further validation and meaningful application of the PENS and GEQ we examined the underlying factorial structure of both questionnaires. Four hundred and forty-seven participants played two different games and rated them on a set of various variables including the PENS and GEQ. Consistent with previous research we gained additional insight into optimization of both measurements. While the factor structure of the PENS appears to be consistent and invariant across two different games, the GEQ reveals weaknesses in fulfilling these requirements.	digital games; factor analysis; game experience; questionnaire	Florian Bruhlmann; Gian-Marco Schmid	CHI EA '15: Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/2702613.2732831		1181-1186			Excluded	snowballing			2	ACM	2015	CHI Extended Abstracts - How to Measure the Game Experience?: Analysis of the Factor Structure of Two Questionnaires	https://doi.org/10.1145/2702613.2732831	Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
1035	GameSE_abstract	An empirical evaluation of user interfaces for a mobile video game	In this paper we empirically test the effectiveness and enjoyability of three user interfaces used to play an iPod Touch scroll shooter video game. Mobile devices are currently undergoing a surge in market penetration both in business and with consumers. These devices allow for user interface options such as touch screens and accelerometers, which are novel to mobile platforms and to large portions of the general public. To explore the effectiveness and enjoyability of these user interface options, the game was implemented with an accelerometer based interface, a touch screen based interface involving simulated buttons and a touch screen based interface involving finger gestures. The game has been formally tested with 36 human subjects each playing the game with each of the three interfaces. We present statistically significant results that the accelerometer based interface was the preferred interface and the interface in which participants performed best. We hope manufacturers will consider using the approach used in this paper to test user interfaces in-house before releasing them, since, as we show, it is inexpensive to obtain statistically significant results. We propose heuristics for mobile user interface design based on an analysis of the results and suggest an avenue for future work.

1037	GameSE_abstract	Interactive design exploration with Alt.Text	It is well accepted that search is an effective model for design. Newell and Simons' Human Information Processing model is foundational to this view. Designers use symbols and structures to express, store, off-load, recall, and manage their work.They mix general and detailed elements, organize their problemspace differently, seek ways to identify repetitive tasks, and utilize external media.An integral aspect of designsearch is the comparison of alternatives, because the goal is usually to come close, if not fully satisfy, a set of requirements. Searching problem-spaces with currently available tools is challenging due to a number of issues related to creating and comparing alternative representations of one's thought process and outcome. In this paper, we present Alt.Text, a prototype that we developed to explore strategies for supporting design search.While Alt.Text only handles text-based documents, we believe that many of its features can be generalized to the domain of architectural design.

1038	GameSE_abstract	Knowledge practices in design: The role of visual representations as 'Epistemic objects'	We use a detailed study of the knowledge work around visual representations to draw attention to the multidimensional nature of 'objects'. Objects are variously described in the literatures as relatively stable or in flux; as abstract or concrete; and as used within or across practices. We clarify these dimensions, drawing on and extending the literature on boundary objects, and connecting it with work on epistemic and technical objects. In particular, we highlight the epistemic role of objects, using our observations of knowledge work on an architectural design project to show how, in this setting, visual representations are characterized by a 'lack' or incompleteness that precipitates unfolding. The conceptual design of a building involves a wide range of technical, social and aesthetic forms of knowledge that need to be developed and aligned. We explore how visual representations are used, and how these are meaningful to different stakeholders, eliciting their distinct contributions. As the project evolves and the drawings change, new issues and needs for knowledge work arise. These objects have an 'unfolding ontology' and are constantly in flux, rather than fully formed. We discuss the implications for wider understandings of objects in organizations and for how knowledge work is achieved in practice. copyright	Boundary objects;; Collaborative knowledge work;; Epistemic objects;; Practice;; Technical objects;; Visual representations	Ewenstein, Boris; Whyte, Jennifer	Organization Studies	https://doi.org/10.1177/0170840608083014	Robert, A., Darsa, L.(2006)'A Framework for Examining the Concept of Closure in Innovation Process' in Art of Management and OrganizationKrakow.; Barry, D., Rerup, C.; Bechky, B.A.; Bechky, B.A.; Ulrich, B.(1992)Risk Society.Cited 2984 times.London: Sage.; Carlile, P.R.; Carlile, P.R.; D'Adderio, L.; D'Adderio, L.; Eckert, C., Boujut, J.-F.; Cullinan Architects, E.(1984)Edward Cullinan Architects.Cited 3 times.London: RIBA Publications Limited.; Cullinan Architects, E.(2004)Herbarium and Library Extension at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew: Report for Stage C (Outline Proposals).Cited 2 times.London: unpublished report.; Cullinan Architects, E.(2005)Herbarium and Library Extension at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew: Report for Stage e (Final Proposals).Cited 2 times.London: unpublished report.; James, E.(1999)The Domain of Images.Cited 256 times.Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press.; Engestram, Y., Blackler, F.'Special issue: On the life of the object'(2005)Organization, 12 (3).Cited 4 times.; Ewenstein, B., Whyte, J.; Anthony, G.(1990)The Consequences of Modernity.Cited 62 times.Cambridge : Polity.; Glaser Barney, G., Strauss, A.L.(1967)The Discovery of Grounded Theory.Cited 60143 times.London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson.; Jonathan, H.(2005)Ends, Middles, BeginningsLondon: Blackdog Publishing.; Heath, C., Button, G.; Heath, C., Knoblauch, H., Luff, P.; Henderson, K.; Katherine, H.(1999)On Line and on Paper: Visual Representations, Visual Culture and Computer Graphics in Design EngineeringBoston, MA : MIT Press.; Cetina, K.K.; Cetina Karin, K.Objectual practice(2001)The Practice Turn in Contemporary Theory, pp. 175-188.Cited 551 times.Theodore R.

1039	GameSE_abstract	Overcoming Glossophobia Based on Virtual Reality and Heart Rate Sensors	Glossophobia or commonly called speech anxiety is the fear of public speaking. It is a psychological disorder which a person is afraid to speak in public or can be interpreted as nervous. This problem is caused by the lack of preparation or training carried out to public speaking. In Addition, the training is generally lack the atmosphere or impression like speaking in public. Therefore, this system was created for helping someone in preparation before public speaking. This system simulation for practicing public speaking based on technology such as virtual reality, video 360, and arduino heart rate sensors. The results of the functionality and non-functionality of the system have been fully implemented and are running well. In addition, based on the results of the questionnaire and test of objectivity, this system has good feedback for helping someone to prepare and practice in public speaking based on virtual reality technology.

1040	GameSE_abstract	English education game using non-player character based on natural language processing	Game education is a game that aims for educational and entertainment. But the educational game is not popular to users. Therefore, it takes innovation and other ways to improve the educational game itself. Based on the current user survey, games that have dynamic elements such as artificial intelligence are sufficiently requested by users. For this reason, this study aims to build educational games that implement artificial intelligent (AI). In a game, AI is often implemented as Non-Player Character (NPC). The method used for NPCs in this game is based on the Natural Language Processing approach. This is so that the NPC can answer questions about English automatically. The results show that the educational game that has this NPC gets an average score above 75% of users. In addition, users also provide positive feedback on the game itself apart from the questionnaire. So it can be concluded that the presence of NPCs in educational games can increase user interest. With this new approach, it is hoped that it can also increase the popularity ranking of the educational game genre.

1041	GameSE_abstract	Work in progress - A survey of popular game creation platforms used for computing education	Because of the large appeal of video games, many educators are introducing computing concepts through video game development. By teaching students through video game development, teachers have the opportunity to continuously engage students, and students have fun while learning. In this paper, we present a review of game development platforms that have been used as teaching tools. We survey the attributes of different game development environments as well as their pros and cons. We investigate each platform to determine the following metrics: the type of interface the platform uses (graphical, textual or both), the language used to program the game (if applicable), the level of the intended user, whether the platform provides a debugging mechanism, and whether it provides a sharing mechanism. This literature review can be used to assist future development of teaching materials that engage students in computing via game development.

We investigate each platform to determine the following metrics: the type of interface the platform uses (graphical, textual or both), the language used to program the game (if applicable), the level of the intended user, whether the platform provides a debugging mechanism, and whether it provides a sharing mechanism. This literature review can be used to assist future development of teaching materials that engage students in computing via game development. (c) 2011 IEEE."",

1042	GameSE_abstract	MACE: A New Interface for Comparing and Editing of Multiple Alternative Documents for Generative Design	We present a new interface for interactive comparisons of more than two alternative documents in the context of a generative design system that uses generative data-flow networks defined via directed acyclic graphs. To better show differences between such networks, we emphasize added, deleted, (un)changed nodes and edges. We emphasize differences in the output as well as parameters using highlighting and enable post-hoc merging of the state of a parameter across a selected set of alternatives. To minimize visual clutter, we introduce new difference visualizations for selected nodes and alternatives using additive and subtractive encodings, which improve readability and keep visual clutter low. We analyzed similarities in networks from a set of alternative designs produced by architecture students and found that the number of similarities outweighs the differences, which motivates use of subtractive encoding. We ran a user study to evaluate the two main proposed difference visualization encodings and found that they are equally effective.	parallel editing;  generative design;  exploration;  difference visualization.;  alternatives	Zaman, Loutfouz; Stuerzlinger, Wolfgang; Neugebauer, Christian	DocEng '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM Symposium on Document Engineering	https://doi.org/10.1145/3103010.3103013		67-76	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3103010.3103013,

1043	GameSE_abstract	Rewriting history: more power to creative people	Trying out different alternatives is a natural part of creative work, resulting in several versions that are hard to manage. With the tools available today, we often end up having to manually redo changes that worked in one version on other versions. We propose a new approach for supporting creative work: an artifact is described as the history of the operations that created it. We show that by allowing users to change this history, the common use cases of merging, generalizing and specializing can be supported efficiently. This rewriting history approach is based on a formal specification of the operations offered by a tool, leads to a new theory of operations, and enables exciting new ways to share and combine creative work. It is complementary to state-based version control, and offers the user a new understanding of merging. The approach was implemented for a collaborative drawing tool, and evaluated in a user study. The study shows that users understand the approach and would like to use it in their own creative work.	interaction framework;  creative work;  collaboration	Bueno, Carlo; Crossland, Sarah; Lutteroth, Christof; Weber, Gerald	OzCHI '11: Proceedings of the 23rd Australian Computer-Human Interaction Conference	https://doi.org/10.1145/2071536.2071545		62-71	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2071536.2071545,

1046	GameSE_abstract	An OpenWRT solution for future wireless homes	Most of future digital services for home and office users will be deployed and delivered through the Internet and wireless connectivity. However, employing regular access points (APs) and protocols will not allow an efficient coexistence among heterogeneous application flows. Indeed, real-time and elastic applications are (and will be) supported by different protocols and featured with different performance requirements: low perpacket delay for the former and high throughput for the latter. In this work, we present a work-in-progress evaluation of a new AP prototype able to guarantee a fast and smooth data delivery for real-time streams while maintaining a high throughput for TCP-based applications. Our approach is based on a userspace modification of the AP's code based on OpenWRT operating system so as to appropriately shape transiting network traffic. Preliminary experimental results confirm that our solution represents an optimal candidate to become the center of future wireless in-home scenarios.

1047	GameSE_abstract	d.note:revising user interfaces through change tracking, annotations, and alternatives	Interaction designers typically revise user interface prototypes by adding unstructured notes to storyboards and screen printouts. How might computational tools increase the efficacy of UI revision? This paper introduces d.note, a revision tool for user interfaces expressed as control flow diagrams. d.note introduces a command set for modifying and annotating both appearance and behavior of user interfaces; it also defines execution semantics so proposed changes can be tested immediately. The paper reports two studies that compare production and interpretation of revisions in d.note to freeform sketching on static images (the status quo). Therevision productionstudy showed that testing of ideas during the revision process led to more concrete revisions, but that the tool also affected the type and number of suggested changes. Therevision interpretationstudy showed that d.note revisions required fewer clarifications, and that additional techniques for expressing revision intent could be beneficial.	annotation; interaction design tools; prototyping; revision	Bjorn Hartmann; Sean Follmer; Antonio Ricciardi; Timothy Cardenas; Scott R.

1048	GameSE_abstract	Static stages for heterogeneous programming	Heterogeneous hardware is central to modern advances in performance and efficiency. Mainstream programming models for heterogeneous architectures, however, sacrifice safety and expressiveness in favor of low-level control over performance details. The interfaces between hardware units consist of verbose, unsafe APIs; hardware-specific languages make it difficult to move code between units; and brittle preprocessor macros complicate the task of specializing general code for efficient accelerated execution. We propose a unified low-level programming model for heterogeneous systems that offers control over performance, safe communication constructs, cross-device code portability, and hygienic metaprogramming for specialization. The language extends constructs from multi-stage programming to separate code for different hardware units, to communicate between them, and to express compile-time code optimization. We introduce static staging, a different take on multi-stage programming that lets the compiler generate all code and communication constructs ahead of time. To demonstrate our approach, we use static staging to implement BraidGL, a real-time graphics programming language for CPU-GPU systems. Current real-time graphics software in OpenGL uses stringly-typed APIs for communication and unsafe preprocessing to generate specialized GPU code variants. In BraidGL, programmers instead write hybrid CPU-GPU software in a unified language. The compiler statically generates target-specific code and guarantees safe communication between the CPU and the graphics pipeline stages. Example scenes demonstrate the language's productivity advantages: BraidGL eliminates the safety and expressiveness pitfalls of OpenGL and makes common specialization techniques easy to apply. The case study demonstrates how static staging can express core placement and specialization in general heterogeneous programming.

1049	GameSE_abstract	A system for rapid exploration of shader optimization choices	We present Spire, a shading language and compiler framework that facilitates rapid exploration of shader optimization choices (such as frequency reduction and algorithmic approximation) afforded by modern real-time graphics engines. Our design combines ideas from rate-based shader programming with new language features that expand the scope of shader execution beyond traditional GPU hardware pipelines, and enable a diverse set of shader optimizations to be described by a single mechanism: overloading shader terms at various spatio-temporal computation rates provided by the pipeline. In contrast to prior work, neither the shading language's design, nor our compiler framework's implementation, is specific to the capabilities of any one rendering pipeline, thus Spire establishes architectural separation between the shading system and the implementation of modern rendering engines (allowing different rendering pipelines to utilize its services). We demonstrate use of Spire to author complex shaders that are portable across different rendering pipelines and to rapidly explore shader optimization decisions that span multiple compute and graphics passes and even offline asset preprocessing. We further demonstrate the utility of Spire by developing a shader level-of-detail library and shader auto-tuning system on top of its abstractions, and demonstrate rapid, automatic re-optimization of shaders for different target hardware platforms.	real-time rendering;  shading languages	He, Yong; Foley, Tim; Fatahalian, Kayvon	ACM Trans.

1050	GameSE_abstract	Bomberman as an Artificial Intelligence Platform	"Computer games have a long tradition in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field. They serve the purpose of establishing challenging goals with long term positive repercussions, with researchers trying to develop AIs capable of beating the world human experts. They also provide a good amount of exposition in mainstream media, whilst also giving an engaging environment for teaching computer science concepts in general and AI methods in particular. This thesis aims precisely to contribute to the educational gaming landscape, by providing a novel Bomberman themed platform and several associated intelligent agents. Our first major contribution is precisely the platform itself, Bomberman
as an Artificial Intelligence Platform (BAIP). We provide a fully functional opensource, graphical, language agnostic platform, aimed towards facilitating the study and development of AI methods. We showcase the potential of BAIP and the richness of the selected game environment by developing a plethora of AI agents using different methodologies. At an initial level we introduce a set of basic heuristic methods capable of providing agents with the most essential behavior primitives, equipping them for basic survival in the game environment. At a more advanced level we introduce search-based methods capable of some form of planning. From a machine learning perspective we show how BAIP can be integrated and used with Reinforcement Learning (RL). We use a simple RL problem within the platform and implement both Q-learning and Sarsa algorithms in order to tackle it. This thesis also provides detailed and thorough experimental results about all the developed agents and methods, using the developed platform capabilities. To sum up, this work introduces a new AI platform, gives a strong baseline agent and demonstrates the feasibility of using it for machine learning tasks."	nan	Manuel Anti? 1/2nio da Cruz Lopes	nan	https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/bitstream/10216/91011/2/176444.pdf	nan	96	nan		Excluded	snowballing			2	GoogleScholar	2016	Bomberman as an Artificial Intelligence Platform	https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/bitstream/10216/91011/2/176444.pdf	Faculdade de Ciencias da Universidade do Porto	
1051	GameSE_abstract	Survival education for user on unknown islands using simulation games	Simulation game is a game genre that represents an activity that refers to the real world. This genre is suitable for users who want to learn something like how to drive, how to cook, and how to overcome problems. Besides that, there are also many simulation games circulating in the marketplace such as Playstore. Based on survey, simulation in several games is not has a purpose to learn about how to survive in unknown islands. Therefore, this study aims to build and develop simulation games about education on how to survive for users. In addition, simulation games also apply the finite state machine to make it easier to build the game flow. The results showed that the element of education surviving in the simulation game had a trust value of 87.12%. It can be concluded that the simulation game has been able to be understood as an educational medium for users.

1052	GameSE_abstract	Player's Model: Criteria for a Gameplay Profile Measure	Game designers empirically use psychological and sociological player's model to create the gameplay of their video games. These models are generally implicit and always informal. A formal analysis of the player's model leads to define efficient player behavior profile. It can have numerous applications, for instance adaptation of the content to the player's ability and interest. Our work tries to find a rational way to assess Players Styles, concept suggested by Bartle [1] in 1996. The first step, state of the art of the player model, shows already some interesting criteria that can be used to classify player's styles.

1053	GameSE_abstract	Measuring User Experience in Multiplayer Board Games	Comparison of user experience between multiplayer digital games and board games is largely unexplored in the literature, with no instrument found to suitably measure user experience across game formats. This study explores the use of the Social Presence module of the Games Experience Questionnaire to measure user experience in a multiplayer board game involving 12 participants across 3 separate sessions. Scale analysis and correlation with semistructured interviews held with the participants suggest that the instrument is reliable and valid and can thus be used for measurement and comparison of user experience across game formats. The Games Experience Questionnaire can therefore be used to scale-up board game research by diminishing reliance on interviews as well as to assist in the choice between digital and nondigital implementation of gameplay forming part of an overarching story, such as in transmedial productions.	board games;; multiplayer;; narrative interviews;; transmedia storytelling;; user experience	Barbara, Jonathan	Games and Culture	https://doi.org/10.1177/1555412015593419		623 - 649	"@ARTICLE{Barbara2017623,

1054	GameSE_abstract	Design and implementation of educational game to improve arithmetic abilities for children	Game is an entertainment application for user or children at this time. A game can deploy not only on the computers but also on mobile devices, especially in the Android operating system. But today, many games have an addictive system but has no educational system. The educational game is important for a user to get both education and entertainment. In this paper, a game is using a method to establish a level automatically and varied both in games and educational material attributes. Experiments suggest that the game received positive feedback on the user interface, system performance, and educational lesson. With this result, we conclude that the game is fun and easy to use for the children. With this game, the kids who have played can improve calculating speed level and improve accurately answer for an arithmetic lesson.

1056	GameSE_abstract	The State of the Art in Interactive Global Illumination	The interaction of light and matter in the world surrounding us is of striking complexity and beauty. Since the very beginning of computer graphics, adequate modelling of these processes and efficient computation is an intensively studied research topic and still not a solved problem. The inherent complexity stems from the underlying physical processes as well as the global nature of the interactions that let light travel within a scene. This paper reviews the state of the art in interactive global illumination (GI) computation, i.e., methods that generate an image of a virtual scene in less than 1 s with an as exact as possible, or plausible, solution to the light transport. Additionally, the theoretical background and attempts to classify the broad field of methods are described. The strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, when applied to the different visual phenomena, arising from light interaction are compared and discussed. Finally, the paper concludes by highlighting design patterns for interactive GI and a list of open problems.	volume rendering;  shadowing;  shading;  real-time rendering;  ray tracing;  radiosity;  photon mapping;  interactive rendering;  image synthesis;  global illumination;  and texture/Radiosity/Raytracing;  I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism:;  Colour	Ritschel, Tobias; Dachsbacher, Carsten; Grosch, Thorsten; Kautz, Jan	Comput.

    abstract = ""The interaction of light and matter in the world surrounding us is of striking complexity and beauty. Since the very beginning of computer graphics, adequate modelling of these processes and efficient computation is an intensively studied research topic and still not a solved problem. The inherent complexity stems from the underlying physical processes as well as the global nature of the interactions that let light travel within a scene. This paper reviews the state of the art in interactive global illumination (GI) computation, i.e., methods that generate an image of a virtual scene in less than 1 s with an as exact as possible, or plausible, solution to the light transport. Additionally, the theoretical background and attempts to classify the broad field of methods are described. The strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, when applied to the different visual phenomena, arising from light interaction are compared and discussed. Finally, the paper concludes by highlighting design patterns for interactive GI and a list of open problems. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."",

1057	GameSE_abstract	Deploying and debugging educational games using e-Learning standards	Development, packaging and deployment of educational games following e-Learning standards has benefits, such as improved reusability and interoperability of contents. Moreover, standards can facilitate that games exchange data with other software agents (e.g. Learning Management Systems - LMS) in a standardized manner, which opens up a wide range of possibilities for next generation Game-Based Learning experiences. However, the application of standards to games poses a technical challenge. There is a clear need for tools that simplify this process for teachers and educators with limited technical background. In this paper we present how the <;e-Adventure>; platform is addressing this problem, with special focus in the exchange of data to/from the games. Tools being developed for facilitating packaging, deployment and debugging of educational games with standards are described. On the one hand, these tools facilitate testing and debugging since they allow simulation of game deployment with active communication without needing a back-end LMS. On the other hand, they smooth the learning curve that is needed to understand the standards and their possibilities when combined with games. Finally a case study focusing on the SCORM standard is presented.

1058	GameSE_abstract	Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification	The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is widely used to synchronize computer clocks in the Internet. This document describes NTP version 4 (NTPv4), which is backwards compatible with NTP version 3 (NTPv3), described in RFC 1305, as well as previous versions of the protocol. NTPv4 includes a modified protocol header to accommodate the Internet Protocol version 6 address family. NTPv4 includes fundamental improvements in the mitigation and discipline algorithms that extend the potential accuracy to the tens of microseconds with modern workstations and fast LANs. It includes a dynamic server discovery scheme, so that in many cases, specific server configuration is not required. It corrects certain errors in the NTPv3 design and implementation and includes an optional extension mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]	nan	Mills, D.; J.

1059	GameSE_abstract	Does Rust SPARK Joy? Safe Bindings from Rust to SPARK, Applied to the BBQueue Library	Both Rust and SPARK are memory-safe programming languages and feature stronger safety guarantees than other popular programming languages for embedded software. However, modern systems often combine software written in multiple programming languages using the Foreign Function Interface (FFI). When using safety-oriented programming languages such as Rust and SPARK, maintaining compile-time safety guarantees across a language boundary is a challenge. The objective of this study is to explore if/how the inherent safety guarantees of these languages are preserved, and their potential benefits when establishing a library interface between them. In particular, we apply our method to the BBQueue circular buffer library that features complex ownership hand-over patterns when using FFI. Results reveal that most of the inherent consistency and safety features of these languages can be maintained. Yet, special caution is required at the FFI boundary to prevent potential vulnerabilities.	safety-critical code;  language bindings;  foreign function interface;  embedded systems;  SPARK;  Rust	"Maiga, A\""{\i}ssata; Artho, Cyrille; Gilcher, Florian; Moy, Yannick"	SIGMOD '15: Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data	https://doi.org/10.1145/3623503.3623534		37-47	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3623503.3623534,

1060	GameSE_abstract	Boundary object use in cross-cultural software development teams	This article examines the evolving use of boundary objects in cross-cultural software teams. Our field study of a Jamaican-Indian team examines the use of software specifications and project management tools as boundary objects in facilitating sharing across knowledge boundaries. We examine how and why the role and use of boundary objects may facilitate collaboration across knowledge boundaries at one time and contribute to conflict at other times. We unpack the interacting elements that both facilitate and constrain knowledge sharing, and trigger conflicts at different stages of the software team development. Specifically, we found that the use of boundary objects at transitions involving definitional control and the subsequent redistribution of power/authority may inhibit knowledge sharing. The subsequent reifying of cultural boundaries along with negative stereotyping led to relational conflict, through a process we call culturizing, as cross-cultural differences emerged as problematic for team dynamics.	boundary objects; collaboration; conflict; cross-cultural; information systems development; knowledge; software development; teams	Barrett, Michael; Oborn, Eivor	Human Relations	https://doi.org/10.1177/0018726709355657	{[}Anonymous], 2004, INSIDE VIRTUAL PRODU. {[}Anonymous], READINGS DISTRIBUTED.

1061	GameSE_abstract	10 Coordination in Organizations: An Integrative Perspective	Coordination, the process of interaction that integrates a collective set of interdependent tasks, is a central purpose of organizations. In this review we begin by discussing the origins of interest in coordination, tracing some of the classic perspectives. We present a review of recent literature on coordination in organizations arranged according to the mechanisms that help achieve it. We then go beyond this review to provide a framework to understand what different coordination mechanisms and activities accomplish. We propose that coordination mechanisms (such as routines, meetings, plans, and schedules) impact the work of organizations by creating three integrative conditions for coordinated activity: accountability, predictability, and common understanding. We end by examining the implications of such a perspective for future research on coordination in organizations.	nan	Okhuysen, Gerardo A.; Bechky, Beth A.

1062	GameSE_abstract	Static stages for heterogeneous programming	Heterogeneous hardware is central to modern advances in performance and efficiency. Mainstream programming models for heterogeneous architectures, however, sacrifice safety and expressiveness in favor of low-level control over performance details. The interfaces between hardware units consist of verbose, unsafe APIs; hardware-specific languages make it difficult to move code between units; and brittle preprocessor macros complicate the task of specializing general code for efficient accelerated execution. We propose a unified low-level programming model for heterogeneous systems that offers control over performance, safe communication constructs, cross-device code portability, and hygienic metaprogramming for specialization. The language extends constructs from multi-stage programming to separate code for different hardware units, to communicate between them, and to express compile-time code optimization. We introduce static staging, a different take on multi-stage programming that lets the compiler generate all code and communication constructs ahead of time.

1063	GameSE_abstract	Social debugging game for learning & engagement	The dramatically changing availability and sharing of information online has created new opportunities for informal, discretionary learning, particularly for teenagers. This, along with the rise in online gaming across all ages and genders give rise to questions about how these resources can be used effectively for learning. In my work, I will investigate how social features such as achievement broadcasting, teamwork, and puzzle sharing in an online game can sustainably engage teens and their friends in social learning of programming concepts.

1064	GameSE_abstract	Intelligent System for Agent in Educational Game Using Dynamic Gram Similarity	Today, almost people like a game. A game can make people have fun when playing it. An exciting game must have many feature and menus especially artificial intelligent (AI) called enemy or agent. Agent in game can be build using any method to make smart and intellect. In educational game, smart agent must can choose and decide a right answer of question. In this research, we make an agent to answer English question using dynamic gram similarity. This method based on n-gram similarity method but it can check neighbor word on sentence. Result of this research indicates dynamic gram similarity has 66% which is more accurate answer than unigram, big ram and trigram similarity. The conclusion of this research is dynamic gram similarity can implement to agent in educational game and can answer grammar English question automatically.

1065	GameSE_abstract	Slang: language mechanisms for extensible real-time shading systems	Designers of real-time rendering engines must balance the conflicting goals of maintaining clear, extensible shading systems and achieving high rendering performance. In response, engine architects have established effective design patterns for authoring shading systems, and developed engine-specific code synthesis tools, ranging from preprocessor hacking to domain-specific shading languages, to productively implement these patterns. The problem is that proprietary tools add significant complexity to modern engines, lack advanced language features, and create additional challenges for learning and adoption. We argue that the advantages of engine-specific code generation tools can be achieved using the underlying GPU shading language directly, provided the shading language is extended with a small number of best-practice principles from modern, well-established programming languages. We identify that adding generics with interface constraints, associated types, and interface/structure extensions to existing C-like GPU shading languages enables real-time Tenderer developers to build shading systems that are extensible, maintainable, and execute efficiently on modern GPUs without the need for additional domain-specific tools. We embody these ideas in an extension of HLSL called Slang, and provide a reference design for a large, extensible shader library implemented using Slang's features. We rearchitect an open source Tenderer to use this library and Slang's compiler services, and demonstrate the resulting shading system is substantially simpler, easier to extend with new features, and achieves higher rendering performance than the original HLSL-based implementation.	shading languages;  real-time rendering	He, Yong; Fatahalian, Kayvon; Foley, Tim	ACM Trans.

1066	GameSE_abstract	Hidden Markov Model based Speech Synthesis: A Review	A Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis system is the artificial production of human system. This paper reviews recent research advances in field of speech synthesis with related to statistical parametric approach to speech synthesis based on HMM. In this approach, Hidden Markov Model based Text to speech synthesis (HTS) is reviewed in brief. The HTS is based on the generation of an optimal parameter sequence from subword HMMs. The quality of HTS framework relies on the accurate description of the phoneset. The most attractive part of HTS system is the prosodic characteristics of the voice can be modified by simply varying the HMM parameters, thus reducing the large storage requirement.

1067	GameSE_abstract	Eye-head coordination for visual cognitive processing	"We investigated coordinated movements between the eyes and head (""eye-head coordination"") in relation to vision for action. Several studies have measured eye and head movements during a single gaze shift, focusing on the mechanisms of motor control during eye-head coordination. However, in everyday life, gaze shifts occur sequentially and are accompanied by movements of the head and body. Under such conditions, visual cognitive processing influences eye movements and might also influence eye-head coordination because sequential gaze shifts include cycles of visual processing (fixation) and data acquisition (gaze shifts). In the present study, we examined how the eyes and head move in coordination during visual search in a large visual field. Subjects moved their eyes, head, and body without restriction inside a 360deg visual display system. We found patterns of eye-head coordination that differed those observed in single gaze-shift studies. First, we frequently observed multiple saccades during one continuous head movement, and the contribution of head movement to gaze shifts increased as the number of saccades increased. This relationship between head movements and sequential gaze shifts suggests eye-head coordination over several saccade-fixation sequences; this could be related to cognitive processing because saccade-fixation cycles are the result of visual cognitive processing. Second, distribution bias of eye position during gaze fixation was highly correlated with head orientation. The distribution peak of eye position was biased in the same direction as head orientation. This influence of head orientation suggests that eye-head coordination is involved in gaze fixation, when the visual system processes retinal information. This further supports the role of eye-head coordination in visual cognitive processing."

1068	GameSE_abstract	Coevolving Systems and the Organization of Agile Software Development	Despite the popularity of agile methods in software development and increasing adoption by organizations there is debate about what agility is and how it is achieved. The debate suffers from a lack of understanding of agile concepts and how agile software development is practiced. This paper develops a framework for the organization of agile software development that identifies enablers and inhibitors of agility and the emergent capabilities of agile teams. The work is grounded in complex adaptive systems (CAS) and draws on three principles of coevolving systems: match coevolutionary change rate, maximize self-organizing, and synchronize exploitation and exploration. These principles are used to study the processes of two software development teams, one a team using eXtreme Programming (XP) and the other a team using a more traditional, waterfall-based development cycle. From the cases a framework for the organization of agile software development is developed. Time pacing, self-management with discipline and routinization of exploration are among the agile enablers found in the cases studies while event pacing, centralized management, and lack of resources allocated to exploration are found to be inhibitors to agility. Emergent capabilities of agile teams that are identified from the research include coevolution of business value, sustainable working with rhythm, sharing and team learning, and collective mindfulness.	agile software development; coevolving systems; complex adaptive systems; time-pacing; rhythm; mindfulness; innovation	Vidgen, Richard; Wang, Xiaofeng	INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH	https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.1090.0237		355-376			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2009	Coevolving Systems and the Organization of Agile Software Development	https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.1090.0237	INFORMS	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
1069	GameSE_abstract	Those are not the Stories you are Looking For: Using Text Prototypes to Evaluate Game Narratives Early	In game design, evaluation is important to do early and often; however, evaluating game narratives early in development is an open problem. We don't know how the evaluation of a game narrative will be affected when it is experienced outside of the context of the game's mechanics and graphics. In this paper, we test the plausibility of using a text-based narrative prototype, by evaluating player experience and narrative experience in two studies using different game genres. In both studies, we compare the narrative evaluation of low- and high-fidelity graphics, but in study 1 (N=78), we kept interaction mechanics intact, and in study 2 (N=124), we removed game interaction in the text prototype. We observed no significant differences in player experience or narrative engagement in either study, indicating that text-based narrative prototypes could be an effective playtesting tool for game studios to integrate into their development cycle early.	transportability;  prototyping;  narrative;  digital games	Bowey, Jason T.; Mandryk, Regan L.

1070	GameSE_abstract	Game Development Software Engineering Process Life Cycle: A Systematic Review	Abstract:Software game is a kind of application that is used not only for entertainment, but also for serious purposes that can be applicable to different domains such as education, business, and health care. Although the game development process differs from the traditional software development process because it involves interdisciplinary activities. Software engineering techniques are still important for game development because they can help the developer to achieve maintainability, flexibility, lower effort and cost, and better design. The purpose of this study is to assesses the state of the art research on the game development software engineering process and highlight areas that need further consideration by researchers. In the study, we used a systematic literature review methodology based on well-known digital libraries. The largest number of studies have been reported in the production phase of the game development software engineering process life cycle, followed by the pre-production phase. By contrast, the post-production phase has received much less research activity than the pre-production and production phases. The results of this study suggest that the game development software engineering process has many aspects that need further attention from researchers; that especially includes the postproduction phase.

1071	GameSE_abstract	Prosodic analysis of a corpus of tales	This paper presents a prosodic analysis of a corpus of 12 tales, read by one male speaker. The work is part of a project which aims at providing storytelling capacities to a humanoid robot. One main point is to improve text-to-speech synthesis expressivity according to a semi-automatic analysis of a given tale. Automatic tagging and prosodic stylization were applied to the corpus. The extracted parameters are described and analyzed according to relevant elements of the tales' structure.

1072	GameSE_abstract	How practitioners approach gameplay requirements? An exploration into the context of massive multiplayer online role-playing games	Gameplay requirements are central to game development. In the business context of massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMOGs) where game companies' revenues rely on players' monthly subscriptions, gameplay is also recognized as the key to player retention. However, information on what gameplay requirements are and how practitioners 'engineer' them in real life is scarce. This exploratory study investigates how practitioners developing MMOGs reason about gameplay requirements and handle them in their projects. 12 practitioners from three leading MMOGs-producing companies were interviewed and their gameplay requirements documents were reviewed. The study's most important findings are that in MMOG projects: (1) gameplay requirements are co-created with players, (2) are perceived and treated by practitioners as sets of choices and consequences, (3) gameplay is endless within a MMOG, and while gameplay requirements do not support any game-end goal, they do support a level-end goal, (4) 'paper-prototyping' and play-testing are pivotal to gameplay validation, (5) balancing the elements of the gameplay is an on-going task, perceived as the most difficult and labor-consuming, (6) gameplay happens both in-game and out-of-the game. We conclude with discussion on validity threats to our results and on implications for research and practice.

1073	GameSE_abstract	Next-generation of virtual personal assistants (Microsoft Cortana, Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa and Google Home)	One of the goals of Artificial intelligence (AI) is the realization of natural dialogue between humans and machines. in recent years, the dialogue systems, also known as interactive conversational systems are the fastest growing area in AI. Many companies have used the dialogue systems technology to establish various kinds of Virtual Personal Assistants(VPAs) based on their applications and areas, such as Microsoft's Cortana, Apple's Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Facebook's M. However, in this proposal, we have used the multi-modal dialogue systems which process two or more combined user input modes, such as speech, image, video, touch, manual gestures, gaze, and head and body movement in order to design the Next-Generation of VPAs model. The new model of VPAs will be used to increase the interaction between humans and the machines by using different technologies, such as gesture recognition, image/video recognition, speech recognition, the vast dialogue and conversational knowledge base, and the general knowledge base. Moreover, the new VPAs system can be used in other different areas of applications, including education assistance, medical assistance, robotics and vehicles, disabilities systems, home automation, and security access control.

1075	GameSE_abstract	From Knowing It to “Getting It”: Envisioning Practices in Computer Games Development	The development of information systems and software applications increasingly needs to deliver culturally rich and affective experiences for user groups. In this paper, we explore how the collaborative practices across different expert groups can enable this experiential dimension of use to be integrated into the development of a software product. In an empirical study of computer games development---an arena in which the novelty and richness of the user experience is central to competitive success---we identify the challenges of conceptualizing and realizing a desired user experience when it cannot be readily specified in an initial design template, nor represented within the expertise of existing groups. Our study develops a theoretical framework to address these challenges. Through this framework, we are able to show how achieving a desired user experience requires developer groups to not only work across the boundaries that arise from specialized expertise, but also across wider fields centred on cultural production and software development, respectively. We find that their ability to do this is supported by distinctive “envisioning practices” that sustain an emerging shared “vision” for each game. The key research contributions that we then make are a grounding envisioning practices as a means of theorizing the collaborative practices centred on conceptualizing the user experience; b identifying how these practices are interwoven with the “producing practices” of software development, thus enabling collaboration to span expert groups and disparate fields; and c theorizing the role of vision as an emerging conceptual boundary object in these practices.

1076	GameSE_abstract	A control theory perspective on agile methodology use and changing user requirements	In this paper, we draw on control theory to understand the conditions under which the use of agile practices Iis most effective in improving software project quality. Although agile development methodologies offer the potential of improving software development outcomes, limited research has examined how project managers can structure the software development environment to maximize the benefits of agile methodology use during a project. As a result, project managers have little guidance on how to manage teams who are using agile methodologies. Arguing that the most effective control modes are those that provide teams with autonomy in determining the methods for achieving project objectives, we propose hypotheses related to the interaction between control modes, agile methodology use, and requirements change. We test the model in a field study of 862 software developers in 110 teams. The model explains substantial variance in four objective measures of project quality-bug severity, component complexity, coordinative complexity, and dynamic complexity. Results largely support our hypotheses, highlighting the interplay between project control, agile methodology use, and requirements change. The findings contribute to extant literature by integrating control theory into the growing literature on agile methodology use and by identifying specific contingencies affecting the efficacy of different control modes. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our results.

1077	GameSE_abstract	Risk Management in Video Game Development Projects	The video game software industry has a reputation for volatile, chaotic projects yet, in spite of dramatic growth in global revenues, surprisingly little academic work has examined these projects. This study reports a preliminary investigation into this under-researched area. We interviewed eight video game producers from a range of companies, using a critical incident method to explore risk management practices and risk perceptions. Our results revealed that in lieu of formal risk management practices, these managers relied on prototyping, pre-production decision points, and agile approaches to contain risk on their projects. Among the risk factors mentioned, two are specific to the unique context of video game development. The risk of failing to match the development strategy to the project was identified as a major cause of problems during the development process, and a new risk - the 'fun factor' - was a key element threatening the success of the final game release.

1078	GameSE_abstract	Design for Research Results: Experimental Prototyping and Play Testing	In this article, the authors examine iterative design methods for experimental game prototype development. They recognize the area of game design as a wicked problem space, that is, an area where attempts at producing solutions change the understanding of the problems. They argue that it is vital in game-design research to build and test designs in order to explore how certain game mechanics can result in different play dynamics and play experiences. Depending on the scope of research questions and available resources, it is important to carefully plan the design process of prototypes, their development, and the testing of them. It is also important to consider what types of data to obtain, and how to treat the data, in order to acquire materials for analysis that can support the exploration of the research questions of a study. The purpose of this article is to provide a navigation aid through this process. Various methods of prototyping and types of prototypes are described, along with considerations regarding the type of game that is developed. Then, various types of play tests are presented along with recommendations, depending on timing within the production cycle and availability of test-players. Also, an overview of potential methods of obtaining data from play tests is provided.	data types;  design navigation;  design process;  evaluation;  game design;  game research;  game type;  iterative design;  play test;  play-based design;  playability;  production cycle;  prototype development;  prototyping;  research method;  sketching;  wicked problem	Eladhari, Mirjam P.; Ollila, Elina M.I.

1081	GameSE_abstract	The interblink interval in normal and dry eye subjects	Purpose:Our aim was to extend the concept of blink patterns from average interblink interval (IBI) to other aspects of the distribution of IBI. We hypothesized that this more comprehensive approach would better discriminate between normal and dry eye subjects.Methods:Blinks were captured over 10 minutes for ten normal and ten dry eye subjects while viewing a standardized televised documentary. Fifty-five blinks were analyzed for each of the 20 subjects. Means, standard deviations, and autocorrelation coefficients were calculated utilizing a single random effects model fit to all data points and a diagnostic model was subsequently fit to predict probability of a subject having dry eye based on these parameters.Results:Mean IBI was 5.97 seconds for normal versus 2.56 seconds for dry eye subjects (ratio: 2.33, P = 0.004). IBI variability was 1.56 times higher in normal subjects (P < 0.001), and the autocorrelation was 1.79 times higher in normal subjects (P = 0.044). With regard to the diagnostic power of these measures, mean IBI was the best dry eye versus normal classifier using receiver operating characteristics (0.85 area under curve (AUC)), followed by the standard deviation (0.75 AUC), and lastly, the autocorrelation (0.63 AUC). All three predictors combined had an AUC of 0.89. Based on this analysis, cutoffs of <=3.05 seconds for median IBI, and <=0.73 for the coefficient of variation were chosen to classify dry eye subjects.Conclusion:(1) IBI was significantly shorter for dry eye patients performing a visual task compared to normals; (2) there was a greater variability of interblink intervals in normal subjects; and (3) these parameters were useful as diagnostic predictors of dry eye disease. The results of this pilot study merit investigation of IBI parameters on a larger scale study in subjects with dry eye and other ocular surface disorders.Keywords:diagnostic model; dry eye; interblink intervals; visual function; visual tasks.

1082	GameSE_abstract	Positioning and presenting design science research for maximum impact	Design science research (DSR) has staked its rightful ground as an important and legitimate Information Systems (IS) research paradigm. We contend that DSR has yet to attain its full potential impact on the development and use of information systems due to gaps in the understanding and application of DSR concepts and methods. This essay aims to help researchers (1) appreciate the levels of artifact abstractions that may be DSR contributions, (2) identify appropriate ways of consuming and producing knowledge when they are preparing journal articles or other scholarly works, (3) understand and position the knowledge contributions of their research projects, and (4) structure a DSR article so that it emphasizes significant contributions to the knowledge base. Our focal contribution is the DSR knowledge contribution framework with two dimensions based on the existing state of knowledge in both the problem and solution domains for the research opportunity under study. In addition, we propose a DSR communication schema with similarities to more conventional publication patterns, but which substitutes the description of the DSR artifact in place of a traditional results section. We evaluate the DSR contribution framework and the DSR communication schema via examinations of DSR exemplar publications.

1083	GameSE_abstract	A teamwork model for understanding an agile team: A case study of a Scrum project	Context: Software development depends significantly on team performance, as does any process that involves human interaction. Objective: Most current development methods argue that teams should self-manage. Our objective is thus to provide a better understanding of the nature of self-managing agile teams, and the teamwork challenges that arise when introducing such teams. Method: We conducted extensive fieldwork for 9 months in a software development company that introduced Scrum. We focused on the human sensemaking, on how mechanisms of teamwork were understood by the people involved. Results: We describe a project through Dickinson and McIntyre's teamwork model, focusing on the interrelations between essential teamwork components. Problems with team orientation, team leadership and coordination in addition to highly specialized skills and corresponding division of work were important barriers for achieving team effectiveness. Conclusion: Transitioning from individual work to self-managing teams requires a reorientation not only by developers but also by management. This transition takes time and resources, but should not be neglected. In addition to Dickinson and McIntyre's teamwork components, we found trust and shared mental models to be of fundamental importance.

One of the instances of these techniques, called HMM-based generation synthesis (or simply HMM-based synthesis), has recently been shown to be very effective in generating acceptable speech synthesis. This paper also contrasts these techniques with the more conventional unit selection technology that has dominated speech synthesis over the last ten years. Advantages and disadvantages of statistical parametric synthesis are highlighted as well as identifying where we expect the key developments to appear in the immediate future.	speech synthesis; hidden Markov models	Black, Alan W.; Zen, Heiga; Tokuda, Keiichi	Speech Communication	https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000248909200308	ABDELHAMID O, 1909, INTERSPEECH, P1332. {[}Anonymous], 1999, P EUROSPEECH. {[}Anonymous], 1997, Eurospeech97. {[}Anonymous], BLIZZ CHALL WORKSH. {[}Anonymous], IEEE SPEECH SYNTH WO.

Specific aspects of voice banking are discussed in the paper, including a description of the adjustments of the generic methods. The main attention is paid to the speech corpus building since the quality of synthesised speech depends a lot on the speech units variability and the number of their occurrences. Also some statistics and characteristics of the first experimental voices are presented and the possibility of using different speech synthesis methods depending on the voice quality and speech corpus size is pointed out.

1087	GameSE_abstract	Feedback and the Rationing of Time and Effort Among Competing Tasks	The study described here tested a model of how characteristics of the feedback environment influence the allocation of resources (time and effort) among competing tasks. Results demonstrated that performers invest more resources on tasks for which higher quality (more timely and more specific) feedback is available; this effect was partially mediated by task salience and task expectancies. Feedback timing and feedback specificity demonstrated both main and interaction effects on resource allocations. Results also demonstrated that performers do better on tasks for which higher quality feedback is available; this effect was mediated by resources allocated to tasks. The practical and theoretical implications of the role of the feedback environment in managing performance are discussed.	feedback; multiple goals; decision making; expectancies; self-regulation	Northcraft, Gregory B.; Schmidt, Aaron M.; Ashford, Susan J.

1088	GameSE_abstract	A Lagrangian heuristic for sprint planning in agile software development	Agile methods for software development promote iterative design and implementation. Most of them divide a project into functionalities, called user stories; at each iteration, often called a sprint, a subset of user stories are developed. The sprint planning phase is critical to ensure the project success, but it is also a difficult problem because several factors impact on the optimality of a sprint plan, e.g., the estimated complexity, business value, and affinity of the user stories to be included in each sprint. In this paper we present an approach for sprint planning based on an integer linear programming model. Given the estimates made by the project team and a set of development constraints, the optimal solution of the model is a sprint plan that maximizes the business value perceived by users. Solving to optimality the model by a general-purpose MIP solver, such as IBM llog Cplex, takes time and for some instances even finding a feasible solution requires too large computing times for an operational use. For this reason we propose an effective Lagrangian heuristic based on a relaxation of the proposed model and some greedy and exchange algorithms. Computational results on both real and synthetic projects show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

1089	GameSE_abstract	Effects of feedback in a computer-based assessment for learning	The effects of written feedback in a computer-based assessment for learning on students' learning outcomes were investigated in an experiment at a Higher Education institute in the Netherlands. Students were randomly assigned to three groups, and were subjected to an assessment for learning with different kinds of feedback. These are immediate knowledge of correct response (KCR) + elaborated feedback (EF), delayed KCR + EF, and delayed knowledge of results (KR). A summative assessment was used as a post-test. No significant effect was found for the feedback condition on student achievement on the post-test. Results suggest that students paid more attention to immediate than to delayed feedback. Furthermore, the time spent reading feedback was positively influenced by students' attitude and motivation. Students perceived immediate KCR + EF feedback to be more useful for learning than KR. Students also had a more positive attitude towards feedback in a CBA when they received KCR + EF rather than KR only.

1090	GameSE_abstract	Controlling the uncontrollable: ‘Agile’ teams and illusions of autonomy in creative work	The creative industries have recently been hailed as presenting a liberating model for the future of work and a valuable terrain on which to examine purported new regimes of workplace control. This article, based on the empirical examination of a Canadian video game development studio, traces the modes of control which operate on and through project teams in creative settings. The impact of the adoption of an ‘emancipatory’, post-bureaucratic project management technology, ‘Agile’, is critically examined through interviews and non-participative observation of management, technical and artistic labour within one project team.

1091	GameSE_abstract	Consolidating a process for the design, representation, and evaluation of reference architectures	Reference architectures have emerged as a special type of software architecture that achieves well-recognized understanding of specific domains, promoting reuse of design expertise and facilitating the development, standardization, and evolution of software systems. Because of their advantages, several reference architectures have been proposed and have been also successfully used, including in the industry. However, the most of these architectures are still built using an ad-hoc approach, lacking of a systematization to their construction. If existing, these approaches could motivate and promote the building of new architectures and also support evolution of existing ones. In this scenario, the main contribution of this paper is to present the evolution of ProSA-RA, a process that systematizes the design, representation, and evaluation of reference architectures. ProSA-RA has been already applied in the establishment of reference architectures for different domains and this experience was used to evolve our process. In this paper, we illustrate an application of ProSA-RA in the robotics domain. Results achieved through the use of ProSA-RA have showed us that it is a viable, efficient process and, as a consequence, it could contribute to the reuse of knowledge in several applications domains, by promoting the establishment of new reference architectures.

1092	GameSE_abstract	Requirements Engineering in Scrum Framework	Requirement Engineering (RE) plays an important role in the success of software development life cycle. As RE is the starting point of the life cycle, any changes in requirements will be costly and time consuming. Failure in determining accurate requirements leads to errors in specifications and therefore to a mal system architecture. In addition, most of software development environments are characterized by user requests to change some requirements.Scrum as one of agile development methods that gained a great attention because of its ability to deal with the changing environments. This paper presents and discusses the current situation of RE activities in Scrum, how Scrum benefits from RE techniques and future challenges in this respect.

1093	GameSE_abstract	Software in 30 days: how agile managers beat the odds, delight their customers, and leave competitors in the dust	We, Jeff and Ken, have been in the software industry, collectively, for 70 years. We have been software developers, managers in IT organizations and software product companies, and owners of both product companies and service organizations. More than 20 years ago, we created a process that lets organizations deliver software better. Since then, we have helped hundreds of organizations do the same. Our work has spread further than we have ever imagined possible, being put to use by millions of people. We are humbled by the extent of its adoption, and we are awed by the feats people have accomplished using it. This is not the first book we have written on the topic of building software. It is, however, the first book we have written for people who do not themselves build software. This book is instead for leaders within organizations that depend on software for their survival and competitiveness. It is for leaders within organizations that can benefit from developing software rapidly, inerementally. and with the best return on investment possible. It is for leaders who face business and technological complexity that has made the delivery of software difficult. We have written this book so that these leaders can help their organizations achieve these goals, enhance their internal capabilities, improve their product offerings, and more. This book is for chief executive officers (CEOs), executives, and senior managers who need their organizations to deliver better software in less time, with lower cost, greater predictability, and lower risk. For this audience, we have a message: You may have had negative experiences with software devel- opment in the past, but the industry has turned a corner. The software profes- sion has radically improved its methods and its results. The uncertainty, risk, and waste to which you are accustomed are no longer par for the course. We have worked with many software organizations that have already turned the corner; we want to help you do so, too. In this book, we show you how to create business value using a process that delivers complete pieces of software functionality at least every 30 days. This book will show you how you can prioritize the functionality you want and have it delivered i? 1/2 la carte. It will show you how to gain transparency not only into business value, by tracking functionality delivered against functionality desired, but also into the health of the software development process and your organization as a whole. The tools in this book will help you work with your software organization to get up to speed with modern practices and begin to deliver the results you've been expecting all along. This is software in 30 days.	nan	Schwaber, Ken; Sutherland, Jeff	Software in 30 Days	https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=FSQbYl5HMo8C&oi=fnd&pg=PP11&dq=Software+in+30+Days:+How+Agile+Managers+Beat+the+Odds,+Delight+Their+Customers,+And+Leave+Competitors+In+the+Dust+-+The+Scrum+Guide&ots=V6fElsfP-i&sig=1MZtgdg3yY7QYqedHD2x_gdHmTU#v=onepage&q=Software%20in%2030%20Days%3A%20How%20Agile%20Managers%20Beat%20the%20Odds%2C%20Delight%20Their%20Customers%2C%20And%20Leave%20Competitors%20In%20the%20Dust%20-%20The%20Scrum%20Guide&f=false	nan	185	nan		Excluded	snowballing			2	GoogleScholar	2015	Software in 30 Days: How Agile Managers Beat the Odds, Delight Their Customers, And Leave Competitors In the Dust - The Scrum Guide	https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=FSQbYl5HMo8C&oi=fnd&pg=PP11&dq=Software+in+30+Days:+How+Agile+Managers+Beat+the+Odds,+Delight+Their+Customers,+And+Leave+Competitors+In+the+Dust+-+The+Scrum+Guide&ots=V6fElsfP-i&sig=1MZtgdg3yY7QYqedHD2x_gdHmTU#v=onepage&q=Software%20in%2030%20Days%3A%20How%20Agile%20Managers%20Beat%20the%20Odds%2C%20Delight%20Their%20Customers%2C%20And%20Leave%20Competitors%20In%20the%20Dust%20-%20The%20Scrum%20Guide&f=false	John Wiley & Sons	
1094	GameSE_abstract	A large scale study of programming languages and code quality in github	What is the effect of programming languages on software quality? This question has been a topic of much debate for a very long time. In this study, we gather a very large data set from GitHub (729 projects, 80 Million SLOC, 29,000 authors, 1.5 million commits, in 17 languages) in an attempt to shed some empirical light on this question. This reasonably large sample size allows us to use a mixed-methods approach, combining multiple regression modeling with visualization and text analytics, to study the effect of language features such as static v.s. dynamic typing, strong v.s. weak typing on software quality. By triangulating findings from different methods, and controlling for confounding effects such as team size, project size, and project history, we report that language design does have a significant, but modest effect on software quality. Most notably, it does appear that strong typing is modestly better than weak typing, and among functional languages, static typing is also somewhat better than dynamic typing. We also find that functional languages are somewhat better than procedural languages. It is worth noting that these modest effects arising from language design are overwhelmingly dominated by the process factors such as project size, team size, and commit size. However, we hasten to caution the reader that even these modest effects might quite possibly be due to other, intangible process factors, e.g., the preference of certain personality types for functional, static and strongly typed languages.	bug fix;  code quality;  empirical research;  programming language;  regression analysis;  software domain;  type system	Ray, Baishakhi; Posnett, Daryl; Filkov, Vladimir; Devanbu, Premkumar	FSE 2014: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Foundations of Software Engineering	https://doi.org/10.1145/2635868.2635922		155-165	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2635868.2635922,

1095	GameSE_abstract	Control of Flexible Software Development Under Uncertainty	W hen should software development teams have the flexibility to modify their directions and how do we balance that flexibility with controls essential to produce acceptable outcomes? We use dynamic capabilities theory and an extension of control theory to understand these questions. This work is examined in a case study. Our results demonstrate that flexibility may be needed when the starting conditions are uncertain and that effective control in these situations requires use of traditional controls plus a new type of control we term emergent outcome control.	control theory; uncertainty; flexible development; agile development; emergent outcome control	Harris, Michael L.; Collins, Rosann Webb; Hevner, Alan R.

We use dynamic capabilities theory and an extension of control theory to understand these questions. This work is examined in a case study.

1096	GameSE_abstract	Large-Scale Cross-Country Analysis of Steam Popularity	Steam is a large digital distribution multiplayer and communication platform for PC games and industry standard software. In ever competitive and expanding business markets, data-driven analysis is becoming an essential tool for analyzing consumers. This is especially true for e-markets that exist entirely online, including the video game market. Game data analysis has mainly been confined to work on single games. However, when considering the increasing number of available online platforms that offer multiple games, the large-scale analysis of game popularity on cross-games is getting important for game industry. This study aims to discover interesting relationship patterns among game ownership, genre and geographical region from a very large Steam database. Heat map analysis is used for this purpose. This paper reports the analysis result and explains in depth the implications of patterns discovered.

1097	GameSE_abstract	Facilitating Coordination between Software Developers: A Study and Techniques for Timely and Efficient Recommendations	When software developers fail to coordinate, build failures, duplication of work, schedule slips and software defects can result. However, developers are often unaware of when they need to coordinate, and existing methods and tools that help make developers aware of their coordination needs do not provide timely or efficient recommendations. We describe our techniques to identify timely and efficient coordination recommendations, which we developed and evaluated in a study of coordination needs in the Mylyn software project. We describe how data obtained from tools that capture developer actions within their Integrated Development Environment (IDE) as they occur can be used to timely identify coordination needs; we also describe how properties of tasks coupled with machine learning can focus coordination recommendations to those that are more critical to the developers to reduce information overload and provide more efficient recommendations. We motivate our techniques through developer interviews and report on our quantitative analysis of coordination needs in the Mylyn project. Our results suggest that by leveraging IDE logging facilities, properties of tasks and machine learning techniques awareness tools could make developers aware of critical coordination needs in a timely way. We conclude by discussing implications for software engineering research and tool design.

1098	GameSE_abstract	How is video game development different from software development in open source?	Recent research has provided evidence that, in the industrial context, developing video games diverges from developing software systems in other domains, such as office suites and system utilities.In this paper, we consider video game development in the open source system (OSS) context. Specifically, we investigate how developers contribute to video games vs. non-games by working on different kinds of artifacts, how they handle malfunctions, and how they perceive the development process of their projects. To this purpose, we conducted a mixed, qualitative and quantitative study on a broad suite of 60 OSS projects. Our results confirm the existence of significant differences between game and non-game development, in terms of how project resources are organized and in the diversity of developers' specializations. Moreover, game developers responding to our survey perceive more difficulties than other developers when reusing code as well as performing automated testing, and they lack a clear overview of their system's requirements.	empirical studies;  mining software repositories;  video games	Pascarella, Luca; Palomba, Fabio; Di Penta, Massimiliano; Bacchelli, Alberto	MSR '18: Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories	https://doi.org/10.1145/3196398.3196418		392-402	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3196398.3196418,

1101	GameSE_abstract	Agility from First Principles: Reconstructing the Concept of Agility in Information Systems Development	Awareness and use of agile methods has grown rapidly among the information systems development (ISD) community in recent years. Like most previous methods, the development and promotion of these methods have been almost entirely driven by practitioners and consultants, with little participation from the research community during the early stages of evolution. While these methods are now the focus of more and more research efforts, most studies are still based on XP, Scrum, and other industry-driven foundations, with little or no conceptual studies of ISD agility in existence. As a result, this study proposes that there are a number of significant conceptual shortcomings with agile methods and the associated literature in its current state, including a lack of clarity, theoretical glue, parsimony, limited applicability, and naivety regarding the evolution of the concept of agility in fields outside systems development. Furthermore, this has significant implications for practitioners, rendering agile method comparison and many other activities very difficult, especially in instances such as distributed development and large teams that are not conducive to many of the commercial agile methods. This study develops a definition and formative taxonomy of agility in an ISD context, based on a structured literature review of agility across a number of disciplines, including manufacturing and management where the concept originated, matured, and has been applied and tested thoroughly over time. The application of the texonomy in practice is then demonstrated through a series of thought trials conducted in a large multinational organization. The intention is that the definition and taxonomy can then be used as a starting point to study ISD method agility regardless of whether the method is XP or Scrum, agile or traditional, complete or fragmented, out-of-the-box or in-house, used as is or tailored to suit the project context.	agile; systems development; conceptual research; agile manufacturing; agile management	Conboy, Kieran	INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH	https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.1090.0236		329-354			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2009	Agility from First Principles: Reconstructing the Concept of Agility in Information Systems Development	https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.1090.0236	INFORMS	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

We used concurrent verbal protocol methodology to elicit and operationalize the explicit information processing activities used by 48 trainees performing the Furniture Factory computer simulation. We hypothesized and found support for a moderated mediation model. Increasing feedback specificity influenced the exposure trainees had to different task conditions and negatively affected their levels of explicit information processing. In turn, explicit information processes and levels of exposure to different task conditions interacted to impact transfer of training. Those who received less specific feedback relied more heavily on explicit information processing and had more exposure to the challenging aspects of the task than those who received more specific feedback, which differentially affected what they learned about the task. We discuss how feedback specificity and exposure to different task conditions may prime different learning processes.

1103	GameSE_abstract	Is text-to-speech synthesis ready for use in computer-assisted language learning?	Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, the generation of speech from text input, offers another means of providing spoken language input to learners in Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) environments. Indeed, many potential benefits (ease of creation and editing of speech models, generation of speech models and feedback on demand, etc.) and uses (talking dictionaries, talking texts, dictation, pronunciation training, dialogue partner, etc.) of TTS synthesis in CALL have been put forward. Yet, the use of TTS synthesis in CALL is not widely accepted and only a few applications have found their way onto the market. One potential reason for this is that TTS synthesis has not been adequately evaluated for this purpose. Previous evaluations of TTS synthesis for use in CALL, have only addressed the comprehensibility of TTS synthesis. Yet, CALL places demands on the comprehensibility, naturalness, accuracy, register and expressiveness of the output of TTS synthesis. In this paper, the aforementioned aspects of the quality of the output of four state-of-the-art French TTS synthesis systems are evaluated with respect to their use in the three different roles that TTS synthesis systems may assume within CALL applications, namely: (1) reading machine, (2) pronunciation model and (3) conversational partner [Handley, Z., Hamel, M.-J., 2005. Establishing a methodology for benchmarking speech synthesis for computer-assisted language learning (CALL). Language Learning and Technology Journal 9(3), 99-119. Retrieved from: http://llt.msu.edu/vol9num3/handley/default.html.]. The results of this evaluation suggest that the best TTS synthesis systems are ready for use in applications in which they 'add value' to CALL, i.e. exploit the unique capacity of TTS synthesis to generate speech models on demand. An example of such an application is a dialogue partner. In order to fully meet the requirements of CALL, further attention needs to be paid to accuracy and naturalness, in particular at the prosodic level, and expressiveness.

    abstract = ""Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, the generation of speech from text input, offers another means of providing spoken language input to learners in Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) environments. Indeed, many potential benefits (ease of creation and editing of speech models, generation of speech models and feedback on demand, etc.) and uses (talking dictionaries, talking texts, dictation, pronunciation training, dialogue partner, etc.) of TTS synthesis in CALL have been put forward. Yet, the use of TTS synthesis in CALL is not widely accepted and only a few applications have found their way onto the market. One potential reason for this is that TTS synthesis has not been adequately evaluated for this purpose. Previous evaluations of TTS synthesis for use in CALL, have only addressed the comprehensibility of TTS synthesis. Yet, CALL places demands on the comprehensibility, naturalness, accuracy, register and expressiveness of the output of TTS synthesis. In this paper, the aforementioned aspects of the quality of the output of four state-of-the-art French TTS synthesis systems are evaluated with respect to their use in the three different roles that TTS synthesis systems may assume within CALL applications, namely: (1) reading machine, (2) pronunciation model and (3) conversational partner [Handley, Z., Hamel, M.-J., 2005. Establishing a methodology for benchmarking speech synthesis for computer-assisted language learning (CALL). Language Learning and Technology Journal 9(3), 99-119. Retrieved from: http://llt.msu.edu/vol9num3/handley/default.html.]. The results of this evaluation suggest that the best TTS synthesis systems are ready for use in applications in which they 'add value' to CALL, i.e. exploit the unique capacity of TTS synthesis to generate speech models on demand. An example of such an application is a dialogue partner. In order to fully meet the requirements of CALL, further attention needs to be paid to accuracy and naturalness, in particular at the prosodic level, and expressiveness. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

1104	GameSE_abstract	Migrating Legacy Fortran to Python While Retaining Fortran-Level Performance through Transpilation and Type Hints	We propose a method of accelerating Python code by just-in-time compilation leveraging type hints mechanism introduced in Python 3.5. In our approach performance-critical kernels are expected to be written as if Python was a strictly typed language, however without the need to extend Python syntax. This approach can be applied to any Python application, however we focus on a special case when legacy Fortran applications are automatically translated into Python for easier maintenance. We developed a framework implementing two-way transpilation and achieved performance equivalent to that of Python manually translated to Fortran, and better than using other currently available JIT alternatives (up to 5x times faster than Numba in some experiments).

1105	GameSE_abstract	Danish TV Christmas calendars: Folklore, myth and cultural history	This article aims at characterizing the Danish Christmas calendar as a TV institution and a meeting place for the traditions of the almanac, folklore and the history of culture. Against the background of a brief outline of the history of Danish Christmas calendars, the article explores ways in which this traditional genre has succeeded in renewing itself. The so-called Pyrus series, TV 2i? 1/2s Christmas calendars during the mid-1990s, exhibited folklore, myth and cultural history in a combination of entertainment and information. They were succeeded by calendars such as Jul i Valhal/i? 1/2Christmas in Valhallai? 1/2 (2005), Absalons hemmelighed/i? 1/2The Secret of Absaloni? 1/2 (2006), Mikkel og guldkortet/i? 1/2Mikkel and the Golden Cardi? 1/2 (2008) and Pagten/i? 1/2The Covenanti? 1/2 (2009). Some of these added cultural criticism to the repertoire of the genre.	nan	Agger, Gunhild	Journal of Scandinavian Cinema	https://intellectdiscover.com/content/journals/10.1386/jsca.3.3.267_1	nan	267 - 280	nan		Excluded	snowballing			2	GoogleScholar	2013	Danish TV Christmas calendars: Folklore, myth and cultural history	https://intellectdiscover.com/content/journals/10.1386/jsca.3.3.267_1	Intellect Discover

1107	GameSE_abstract	An empirical study of software release notes	Release notes are an important source of information about a new software release. Such notes contain information regarding what is new, changed, and/or got fixed in a release. Despite the importance of release notes, they are rarely explored in the research literature. Little is known about the contained information, e.g., contents and structure, in release notes. To better understand the types of contained information in release notes, we manually analyzed 85 release notes across 15 different software systems. In our manual analysis, we identify six different types of information (e.g., caveats and addressed issues) that are contained in release notes. Addressed issues refer to new features, bugs, and improvements that were integrated in that particular release. We observe that most release notes list only a selected number of addressed issues (i.e., 6-26 \% of all addressed issues in a release). We investigated nine different factors (e.g., issue priority and type) to better understand the likelihood of an issue being listed in release notes. The investigation is conducted on eight release notes of three software systems using four machine learning techniques. Results show that certain factors, e.g., issue type, have higher influence on the likelihood of an issue to be listed in release notes. We use machine learning techniques to automatically suggest the issues to be listed in release notes. Our results show that issues listed in all release notes can be automatically determined with an average precision of 84 \% and an average recall of 90 \%. To train and build the classification models, we also explored three scenarios: (a) having the user label some issues for a release and automatically suggest the remaining issues for that particular release, (b) using the previous release notes for the same software system, and	Software release notes;  Machine learning techniques;  Empirical study	Abebe, Surafel Lemma; Ali, Nasir; Hassan, Ahmed E.

1108	GameSE_abstract	Engineering emergence: applied theory for game design	Dit proefschrift presenteert twee theoretische kaders voor het ontwerpen van games en beschrijft hoe game designers deze kunnen inzetten om het game ontwerpproces te stroomlijnen. Er bestaan op dit moment meerdere ontwerptheoriei? 1/2en voor games, maar geen enkele kan rekenen op een breed draagvlak binnen de game industrie. Vooral academische ontwerptheoriei? 1/2en hebben regelmatig een slechte reputatie. Het eerste kader dat game designers inzicht biedt in spelregels en hun werking heet Machinations en maakt gebruik van dynamische, interactieve diagrammen. Het tweede theoretische kader van dit proefschrift, Mission/Space, richt zich op level-ontwerp en spelmechanismen die de voortgang van een speler bepalen. In tegenstelling tot bestaande modellen voor level-ontwerp, bouwt Mission/Space voort op het idee dat er in een level twee verschillende structuren bestaan. Mission-diagrammen worden gebruikt om de structuur van taken en uitdagingen voor de speler te formaliseren, terwijl space-diagrammen de ruimtelijke constructie formaliseren. Beide constructies zijn aan elkaar gerelateerd, maar zijn niet hetzelfde. De verschillende wijzen waarop missies geprojecteerd kunnen worden op een bepaalde ruimte speelt uiteindelijk een belangrijke rol in de totstandkoming van de spelervaring.	nan	Dormans, Joris	nan	https://research.hva.nl/en/publications/engineering-emergence-applied-theory-for-game-design	nan	nan	nan		Excluded	snowballing			2	GoogleScholar	2012	Engineering emergence: applied theory for game design	https://research.hva.nl/en/publications/engineering-emergence-applied-theory-for-game-design	Universiteit van Amsterdam	
1109	GameSE_abstract	Discipline Matters: Refactoring of Preprocessor Directives in the #ifdef  Hell	The C preprocessor is used in many C projects to support variability and portability. However, researchers and practitioners criticize the C preprocessor because of its negative effect on code understanding and maintainability and its error proneness. More importantly, the use of the preprocessor hinders the development of tool support that is standard in other languages, such as automated refactoring. Developers aggravate these problems when using the preprocessor in undisciplined ways (e.g., conditional blocks that do not align with the syntactic structure of the code). In this article, we proposed a catalogue of refactorings and we evaluated the number of application possibilities of the refactorings in practice, the opinion of developers about the usefulness of the refactorings, and whether the refactorings preserve behavior. Overall, we found 5,670 application possibilities for the refactorings in 63 real-world C projects. In addition, we performed an online survey among 246 developers, and we submitted 28 patches to convert undisciplined directives into disciplined ones. According to our results, 63 percent of developers prefer to use the refactored (i.e., disciplined) version of the code instead of the original code with undisciplined preprocessor usage. To verify that the refactorings are indeed behavior preserving, we applied them to more than 36 thousand programs generated automatically using a model of a subset of the C language, running the same test cases in the original and refactored programs. Furthermore, we applied the refactorings to three real-world projects: BusyBox, OpenSSL, and SQLite. This way, we detected and fixed a few behavioral changes, 62 percent caused by unspecified behavior in the C programming language.

1110	GameSE_abstract	Inclusive game design:audio interface in a graphical adventure game	A lot of video games on the market are inaccessible to players with visual impairments because they rely heavily on use of graphical elements. This paper presents a project aimed at developing a point-and-click adventure game for smart phones and tablets that is equally functional and enjoyable by blind and sighted players. This will be achieved by utilizing audio to give blind players all necessary information and enjoyment without graphics. In addition to creating the game, the aim of the project is to identify design aspects that can be applied to more types of games to include more players. This paper also presents a pilot study that has been conducted on an early version of the game and the preliminary findings are discussed.	audiogame; inclusive design; mobile game	Per Anders Ostblad; Henrik Engstrom; Jenny Brusk; Per Backlund; Ulf Wilhelmsson	AM '14: Proceedings of the 9th Audio Mostly: A Conference on Interaction With Sound	https://doi.org/10.1145/2636879.2636909		1-8			Excluded	snowballing			2	ACM	2014	Audio Mostly Conference - Inclusive game design: audio interface in a graphical adventure game	https://doi.org/10.1145/2636879.2636909	Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
1111	GameSE_abstract	Self-Organizing Roles on Agile Software Development Teams	Self-organizing teams have been recognized and studied in various forms-as autonomous groups in socio-technical systems, enablers of organizational theories, agents of knowledge management, and as examples of complex-adaptive systems. Over the last decade, self-organizing teams have taken center stage in software engineering when they were incorporated as a hallmark of Agile methods. Despite the long and rich history of self-organizing teams and their recent popularity with Agile methods, there has been little research on the topic within software wngineering. Particularly, there is a dearth of research on how Agile teams organize themselves in practice. Through a Grounded Theory research involving 58 Agile practitioners from 23 software organizations in New Zealand and India over a period of four years, we identified informal, implicit, transient, and spontaneous roles that make Agile teams self-organizing. These roles-Mentor, Coordinator, Translator, Champion, Promoter, and Terminator-are focused toward providing initial guidance and encouraging continued adherence to Agile methods, effectively managing customer expectations and coordinating customer collaboration, securing and sustaining senior management support, and identifying and removing team members threatening the self-organizing ability of the team. Understanding these roles will help software development teams and their managers better comprehend and execute their roles and responsibilities as a self-organizing team.

1112	GameSE_abstract	Model-Driven Game Development Addressing Architectural Diversity and Game Engine-Integration	Model-Driven Game Development (MDGD) is an emerging research field, which uses models to specify some or all of the game elements that traditionally had been manually coded. The PhD thesis presents research in the MDGD domain, which is intended to push MDGD further towards industrialization by reducing two gaps: 1) The integration of MDGD tools and game engines, and 2) The support for a diversity of game architectures. These gaps have been identified through a literature review of existing MDGD approaches, which is also documented in the thesis. To reduce the first gap, the model-driven approach Engine Cooperative Game Modeling (ECGM) has been proposed, which uses a run-time game engine as the base for building a domain framework, and engine tools together with MDGD tools for creating game code and data. The code generator generates both game code and level data from game models, making the game models operable in the engine tools. ECGM has been evaluated through being instantiated with a Domain Specific Language (DSL), Reactive AI Language (RAIL) tools, and the commercial game engine Torque 2D. The DSL and engine were used to develop a prototype game, whose evaluation showed that ECGM can significantly improve the productivity and enable an efficient workflow. To reduce the second gap, the game architecture framework Game Worlds Graph (GWG) has been proposed. GWG has then been used as the conceptual base for a MDGD approach supporting a diversity of game architectures. The GWG-based MDGD approach employs the Global World, Local World, and Connector Type concepts in modeling languages, adding the architectural information to the modeled game elements, with which code for different architectures can be generated. To evaluate the approach, a DSL and its tool-chain were created following the approach, and a prototype game supporting three game architectures were developed. The results of the prototyping showed that the MDGD approach and the DSL resulted in significant improvement in productivity and workflow efficiency. Apart from providing a major research contribution bridging the two gaps described above, the GWG framework itself is a valuable research contribution. The framework can be used for 1) analyzing and classifying existing game architectures, which was proven through a systematic review of 40 game architectures, 2) exploring future architectures resulting in the design of a new game architecture, and 3) aiding MDGD. The RAIL and an extended version of RAIL are also themselves valuable research contributions. The RAIL is a DSL for modeling high-level AI in action/adventure games, and the extended RAIL adds network architecture support to RAIL. Both DSLs are supported by their tool-chains including a model-editor, a semantics validator, and a code generator. These two versions of RAIL can be reused in related MDGD projects or be used as the reference DSLs.	nan	Zhu, Meng	nan	https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2360005	nan	nan	nan		Excluded	snowballing			2	GoogleScholar	2015	Model-Driven Game Development Addressing Architectural Diversity and Game Engine-Integration	https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2360005	NTNU	
1113	GameSE_abstract	Including Visually Impaired Players in a Graphical Adventure Game: A Study of Immersion	The aim of the project presented in this paper is that visually impaired and sighted players should be able to play the same game and share a gaming experience. The goal is that the game should be accessible to visually impaired players without any additional tools, such as text-to-speech, that may reduce the immersion. At the same time, sighted players should perceive the game as a regular game. This paper presents an evaluation of the game where the player immersion has been evaluated through a post test immersion questionnaire. The study was conducted with three independent groups: sighted players using graphics (n=10), blindfolded sighted players (n=10) and visually impaired players (n=9). Although progress in the game and the reported sense of control differed between groups, player immersion was very high in all groups. There were differences between the three groups only in one out of five immersion factors. The result shows that it has been possible to provide an immersive experience irrespective of whether the players are playing the game with graphics or using audio only.

1114	GameSE_abstract	Services in Game Worlds: A Semantic Approach to Improve Object Interaction	To increase a player's immersion in the game world, its objects should behave as one would reasonably expect. For this, it is now becoming increasingly clear that what game objects really miss is richer semantics, not eye-catching visuals. Current games' lack of semantics is mostly due to the difficulty of game designers to realize such complex objects. This paper proposes a solution to this problem in the form of services, characterizing classes of game objects. An example of this is the service of a vending machine, which exchanges a coin for a soda. A three-phased methodology is presented to incrementally specify and add services to game objects. This approach has been implemented and validated by means of a prototype system, which enables a simple and intuitive definition of services in an integrated environment. It is concluded that game objects aware of their services facilitate more and better object interaction, therefore improving gameplay as well.	game worlds; services; semantics; object interaction	Kessing, Jassin; Tutenel, Tim; Bidarra, Rafael	ENTERTAINMENT COMPUTING - ICEC 2009	https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000271451400033		276-281			Excluded	snowballing			2	Web of Science	2009	ICEC - Services in Game Worlds: A Semantic Approach to Improve Object Interaction	https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000271451400033	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLINHEIDELBERGER PLATZ	nan; References; Year; Bibtex

1116	GameSE_abstract	Heuristic evaluation on mobile interfaces: a new checklist	The rapid evolution and adoption of mobile devices raise new usability challenges, given their limitations (in screen size, battery life, etc.) as well as the specific requirements of this new interaction. Traditional evaluation techniques need to be adapted in order for these requirements to be met. Heuristic evaluation (HE), an Inspection Method based on evaluation conducted by experts over a real system or prototype, is based on checklists which are desktop-centred and do not adequately detect mobile-specific usability issues. In this paper, we propose a compilation of heuristic evaluation checklists taken from the existing bibliography but readapted to new mobile interfaces. Selecting and rearranging these heuristic guidelines offer a tool which works well not just for evaluation but also as a best-practices checklist. The result is a comprehensive checklist which is experimentally evaluated as a design tool. This experimental evaluation involved two software engineers without any specific knowledge about usability, a group of ten users who compared the usability of a first prototype designed without our heuristics, and a second one after applying the proposed checklist. The results of this experiment show the usefulness of the proposed checklist for avoiding usability gaps even with nontrained developers.

1117	GameSE_abstract	Expert review method in game evaluations:comparison of two playability heuristic sets	The expert review method is not yet widely adopted in game evaluations, although it has been used successfully in productivity software evaluations for years. In order to use the method effectively, there need to be playability heuristics that take into account the characteristics of the videogames. There are a few playability heuristic sets available, but they have several differences, and they have not been compared to discover their strengths and weaknesses in game evaluations. In this paper, we report on a first study comparing two playability heuristic sets when evaluating the playability of a videogame. The results indicate that the heuristics can assist the evaluators in evaluating both the user interface and the gameplay aspects of the game. However, playability heuristics need to be developed further before they can be utilized by the practitioners.

1119	GameSE_abstract	Group Clustering Using Inter-Group Dissimilarities	Various systems have natural groupings. For instance in large scale distributed system, we can have groups of virtual and/or physical devices. A system can also have groups of time series datasets collected at different time intervals. Such groups are usually characterized by multidimensional metrics (features) set. Clustering such groups using their multidimensional datasets has various applications, such as identifying different performance levels for anomaly detection and load balancing. Traditional algorithms focus on clustering a single time series dataset and not on such groups with multidimensional metrics datasets. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and analysis of two sets of group clustering algorithms. The first set is called one-to-many as it generates clusters of groups by comparing each group against all other groups. The second set of algorithms is called pairwise as it generates the clusters of groups using pairwise group dissimilarity matrix. Both sets of algorithms first generate group dissimilarity weights using metric ranking algorithms. We implemented the group clustering algorithms by extending a well known machine learning package and using a front-end visualizer.We validated the clustering algorithms using real world datasets on the VMware vSAN product. Experimental results show that 7 out of the 8 proposed algorithms can generate expected clusters in at least 4 out of the 6 detailed experiments. In 5 out of the 6 experiments, 3 out of the 8 proposed algorithms can generate the expected clusters. One of the pairwise algorithms can generate the expected clusters in all 6 of the 6 experiments.

1121	GameSE_abstract	Number of people required for usability evaluation: the 10+-2 rule	IntroductionUsability evaluation is essential to make sure that software products newly released are easy to use, efficient, and effective to reach goals, and satisfactory to users. For example, when a software company wants to develop and sell a new product, the company needs to evaluate usability of the new product before launching it at a market to avoid the possibility that the new product may contain usability problems, which span from cosmetic problems to severe functional problems.Three widely used methods for usability evaluation are Think Aloud (TA), Heuristic Evaluation (HE) and Cognitive Walkthrough (CW). TA method is commonly employed with a lab-based user testing, while there are variants of TA methods, including thinking out aloud at user's workplace instead of at labs. What we discuss here is the TA method that is combined with a lab-based user testing, in which test users use products while simultaneously and continuously thinking out aloud, and experimenters record users' behaviors and verbal protocols in the laboratory. HE is a usability inspection method, in which a small number of evaluators find usability problems in a user interface design by examining an interface and judging its compliance with well-known usability principles, called heuristics. CW is a theory-based method, in which evaluators evaluate every step necessary to perform a scenario-based task, and look for usability problems that would interfere with learning by exploration. These three methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. For instance, TA method provides good qualitative data from a small number of test users, but laboratory environment may influence test user's behaviors. HE is a cheap, fast and easy-to-use method, while it often finds too specific and low-priority usability problems, including even not real problems. CW helps find mismatches between users' and designers' conceptualization of a task, but it needs extensive knowledge of cognitive psychology and technical details to apply.However, even though these advantages and disadvantages show overall characteristics of three major usability evaluation methods, we cannot compare them quantitatively and see their efficiency clearly. Because one of reasons why so-called discounted methods, such as HE and CW, were developed is to save costs of usability evaluation, cost-related criteria for comparing usability evaluation are meaningful to usability practitioners as well as usability researchers. One of the most disputable issues related to cost of usability evaluation is sample size. That is, how many users or evaluators are needed to achieve a targeted usability evaluation performance, for example, 80\% of overall discovery rate? The sample size of usability evaluation is known to depend on an estimate of problem discovery rate across participants. The overall discovery rate is a common quantitative measure that is used to show the effectiveness of a specific usability evaluation method in most of usability evaluation studies. It is also called overall detection rate or thoroughness measure, which is the ratio of 'the sum of unique usability problems detected by all experiment participants' against 'the number of usability problems that exist in the evaluated systems', ranging between 0 and 1. The overall discovery rates were reported more than any other criterion measure in the usability evaluation experiments and also a key component for projecting required sample size for usability evaluation study. Thus, how many test users or evaluators participate in the usability evaluation is a critical issue, considering its cost-effectiveness.		Hwang, Wonil; Salvendy, Gavriel	Commun.

1122	GameSE_abstract	Generating Consistent Buildings: A Semantic Approach for Integrating Procedural Techniques	Computer games often take place in extensive virtual worlds, attractive for roaming and exploring. Unfortunately, current virtual cities can strongly hinder this kind of gameplay, since the buildings they feature typically have replicated interiors, or no interiors at all. Procedural content generation is becoming more established, with many techniques for automatically creating specific building elements. However, the integration of these techniques to form complete buildings is still largely unexplored, limiting their application to open game worlds. We propose a novel approach that integrates existing procedural techniques to generate such buildings. With minimal extensions, individual techniques can be coordinated to create buildings with consistently interrelated exteriors and interiors, as in the real world. Our solution offers a framework where various procedural techniques communicate with a moderator, which is responsible for negotiating the placement of building elements, making use of a library of semantic classes and constraints. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by presenting several examples featuring the integration of a facade shape grammar, two different floor plan layout generation techniques, and furniture placement techniques. We conclude that this approach allows one to preserve the individual qualities of existing procedural techniques, while assisting the consistency maintenance of the generated buildings.

1123	GameSE_abstract	Procedural filters for customization of virtual worlds	Designing virtual game worlds is often a long and labor-intensive process. Moreover, when a game world needs to be slightly altered in appearance, the entire process needs to be repeated, or will at least require some repetitious tasks. Ideally, when the same game world is needed under different circumstances (e.g. in another season, before and after a war, in prosperous or poor economic conditions), the designer should be aided in this process using procedural generation techniques.We propose an approach for the specification of procedural filters that describe how (parts of) virtual worlds should be customized to fit a particular situation based on their semantics and the conditions of the situation. This description will guide the customization process by triggering and parametrizing, among others, procedural instructions that can change the appearance of the virtual world. We will discuss how the generic nature of this approach, which favors reusability, and its integration with semantics, which increases the intuitiveness of the design process, can eliminate many of the repetitious tasks involved in performing these actions manually.We describe an implementation of this approach that shows how some simple procedural filters can i) age an urban environment and simulate the effects of poor living conditions on the look of that environment, and ii) apply a party atmosphere to an ordinary office scene.	procedural content generation;  procedural filters;  semantics;  virtual worlds	Tutenel, Tim; van der Linden, Roland; Kraus, Marnix; Bollen, Bart; Bidarra, Rafael	PCGames '11: Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Procedural Content Generation in Games	https://doi.org/10.1145/2000919.2000924		1-8	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2000919.2000924,

We will discuss how the generic nature of this approach, which favors reusability, and its integration with semantics, which increases the intuitiveness of the design process, can eliminate many of the repetitious tasks involved in performing these actions manually.We describe an implementation of this approach that shows how some simple procedural filters can i) age an urban environment and simulate the effects of poor living conditions on the look of that environment, and ii) apply a party atmosphere to an ordinary office scene."",

1125	GameSE_abstract	Using semantics to improve the design of game worlds	Design of game worlds is becoming more and more labor-intensive because of the increasing demand and complexity of content. This is being partially addressed by developing semi-automated procedural techniques that help generate (parts of) game worlds (e.g terrains, cities and buildings). However, most level editors rather deficiently capture and deploy designer's intent. For example, common positional or functional relationships between objects are usually limited to pre-processing a number of anticipated cases.		Tim Tutenel; Ruben M.

1126	GameSE_abstract	Lightweight Procedural Animation With Believable Physical Interactions	In this paper, we describeTwig, a fast, AI-friendly procedural animation system that supports easy authoring of new behaviors. The system provides a simplified dynamic simulation that is specifically designed to be easy to control. Characters are controlled by applying external forces directly to body parts, rather than by simulating joint torques. This ldquopuppetry-stylerdquo of control provides the simplicity of kinematic control within an otherwise dynamic simulation. Although less realistic than motion capture or full biomechanical simulation,Twigproduces compelling, responsive character behavior. Moreover, it is fast, stable, supports believable physical interactions between characters such as hugging, punching, and dragging, and makes it easy to author new behaviors.

1128	GameSE_abstract	Searching for Concurrent Design Patterns in Video Games	The transition to rnulticore architectures has dramatically underscored the necessity for parallelism in software. In particular, while new gaining consoles are by and large multicore, most existing video game engines are essentially sequential and thus cannot easily take advantage of this hardware. In this paper we describe techniques derived from our experience parallelizing an open-source video game Cube 2. We analyze the structure and unique requirements of this complex application domain; drawing conclusions about parallelization tools and techniques applicable therein. Our experience and analysis convinced its that; while existing tools and techniques can be used to solve parts of this problem, none of them constitutes a comprehensive solution. As a result we were inspired to design a new parallel programming environment (PPE) targeted specifically at video game engines and other complex soft real-time systems. The initial implementation of this PPE, Cascade; and its performance analysis are also presented.

1129	GameSE_abstract	A Design Pattern for Parallel Programming of Games	We present a new design pattern, Sayl, for parallel programming of games and real-time simulation applications to make effective use of the multiple cores of CPUs which are becoming commonplace in today's host machines. Sayl is a specialization of the more generic Task Parallelism pattern. The specialization addresses three important requirements of programs in this domain - heterogeneity of tasks, data flow type dependency amongst tasks, and dynamically changing set of active tasks in different frames of the game. Our main claim is that use of Sayl involves less programmer work. Further, by enabling the creation of dynamic task graphs, Sayl can enable parallel execution of tasks both within and across frames; the latter is one significant advantage of Sayl which seems not possible in most other parallelization approaches targeted to this domain. Sayl was used in a case study to convert the serial code of a small game into a parallel version and compared with an-other game parallelization framework. The Sayl version was simpler to code and had better run-time performance.

Earlier work within the field suggests that this is difficult due to synchronization issues. In this paper, we present an implementation of a game server architecture based on a model that allows for massive parallelism. The system is evaluated using traces from live game sessions that has been scaled up to generate massive workloads. We measure the differences in server response time for all objects that need timely updates. We also measure how the response time for the multithreaded implementation varies with the number of threads used.

1131	GameSE_abstract	An adaptative game loop architecture with automatic distribution of tasks between CPU and GPU	This article presents a new architecture to implement all game loop models for games and real-time applications that use the GPU as a mathematics and physics coprocessor, working in parallel processing mode with the CPU. The presented model applies automatic task distribution concepts. The architecture can apply a set of heuristics defined in Lua scripts in order to get acquainted with the best processor for handling a given task. The model applies the GPGPU (general-purpose computation on GPUs) paradigm. In this article we propose an architecture that acquires knowledge about the hardware by running tasks in each processor and, by studying their performance over time, finding the best processor for a group of tasks.

    abstract = ""This article presents a new architecture to implement all game loop models for games and real-time applications that use the GPU as a mathematics and physics coprocessor, working in parallel processing mode with the CPU. The presented model applies automatic task distribution concepts. The architecture can apply a set of heuristics defined in Lua scripts in order to get acquainted with the best processor for handling a given task. The model applies the GPGPU (general-purpose computation on GPUs) paradigm. In this article we propose an architecture that acquires knowledge about the hardware by running tasks in each processor and, by studying their performance over time, finding the best processor for a group of tasks."",

1132	GameSE_abstract	The Free Lunch Is Over: A Fundamental Turn Toward Concurrency in Software	Your free lunch will soon be over. What can you do about it? What are you doing about it? The major processor manufacturers and architectures, from Intel and AMD to Sparc and PowerPC, have run out of room with most of their traditional approaches to boosting CPU performance. Instead of driving clock speeds and straight-line instruction throughput ever higher, they are instead turning en masse to hyperthreading and multicore architectures. Both of these features are already available on chips today; in particular, multicore is available on current PowerPC and Sparc IV processors, and is coming in 2005 from Intel and AMD. Indeed, the big theme of the 2004 In-Stat/MDR Fall Processor Forum was multicore devices, as many companies showed new or updated multicore processors. Looking back, iti? 1/2s not much of a stretch to call 2004 the year of multicore. And that puts us at a fundamental turning point in software development, at least for the next few years and for applications targeting general-purpose desktop computers and low-end servers (which happens to account for the vast bulk of the dollar value of software sold today). In this article, Ii? 1/2ll describe the changing face of hardware, why it suddenly does matter to software, and how specifically the concurrency revolution matters to you and is going to change the way you will likely be writing software in the future. Arguably, the free lunch has already been over for a year or two, only wei? 1/2re just now noticing.	nan	Sutter, Herb	Dr. Dobb's Journal	http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~rge/cosc2200/homework-fall2013/Readings/FreeLunchIsOver.pdf	nan	8	nan		Excluded	snowballing			2	GoogleScholar	2013	The Free Lunch Is Over A Fundamental Turn Toward Concurrency in Software	http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~rge/cosc2200/homework-fall2013/Readings/FreeLunchIsOver.pdf	Guru of the Week	
1133	GameSE_abstract	A survey of multicore processors	"General-purpose multicore processors are being accepted in all segments of the industry, including signal processing and embedded space, as the need for more performance and general-purpose programmability has grown. Parallel processing increases performance by adding more parallel resources while maintaining manageable power characteristics. The implementations of multicore processors are numerous and diverse. Designs range from conventional multiprocessor machines to designs that consist of a ""sea"" of programmable arithmetic logic units (ALUs). In this article, we cover some of the attributes common to all multicore processor implementations and illustrate these attributes with current and future commercial multicore designs. The characteristics we focus on are application domain, power/performance, processing elements, memory system, and accelerators/integrated peripherals."
