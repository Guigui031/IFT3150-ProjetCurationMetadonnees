371	ModelingAssist	Demystifying model transformations: an approach based on automated rule inference	Model-driven development (MDD) is widely used to develop modern business applications. MDD involves creating models at different levels of abstractions. Starting with models of domain concepts, these abstractions are successively refined, using transforms, to design-level models and, eventually, code-level artifacts. Although many tools exist that support transform creation and verification, tools that help users in understanding and using transforms are rare. In this paper, we present an approach for assisting users in understanding model transformations and debugging their input models. We use automated program-analysis techniques to analyze the transform code and compute constraints under which a transformation may fail or be incomplete. These code-level constraints are mapped to the input model elements to generate model-level rules. The rules can be used to validate whether an input model violates transform constraints, and to support general user queries about a transformation. We have implemented the analysis in a tool called XYLEM. We present empirical results, which indicate that (1) our approach can be effective in inferring useful rules, and (2) the rules let users efficiently diagnose a failing transformation without examining the transform source code.	transformation comprehension;  precondition analysis;  model-to-model transform;  model-driven development;  model validation	Nanda, Mangala Gowri; Mani, Senthil; Sinha, Vibha Singhal; Sinha, Saurabh	OOPSLA '09: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGPLAN conference on Object oriented programming systems languages and applications	https://doi.org/10.1145/1640089.1640114		341-360	"@inproceedings{10.1145/1640089.1640114,

521	ModelingAssist	Engaging Developers in Exploratory Unit Testing through Gamification	Exploratory testing, known for its flexibility and ability to uncover unexpected issues, often faces challenges in maintaining systematic coverage and producing reproducible results. To address these challenges, we investigate whether gamification of testing directly in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) can guide exploratory testing. We therefore show challenges and quests generated by the Gamekins gamification system to make testing more engaging and seamlessly blend it with regular coding tasks. In a 60-minute experiment, we evaluated Gamekins' impact on test suite quality and bug detection. The results show that participants actively interacted with the tool, achieving nearly 90\% line coverage and detecting 11 out of 14 bugs. Additionally, participants reported enjoying the experience, indicating that gamification can enhance developer participation in testing and improve software quality.

Since quantum computers perform computations significantly differently than classical computing, testing quantum software running on these quantum computers also differs due to quantum computing's unique characteristics, e.g., entanglement and superposition. Due to the rising interest of the software engineering community in QSE, we will provide an introduction to QST. We will introduce quantum computing and its various principles, quantum software development as quantum circuits, and current QST literature, including a key set of techniques with examples.

782	ModelingAssist	Model driven configuration of fault tolerance solutions for component-based software system	Fault tolerance is very important for complex component-based software systems, but its configuration is complicated and challenging. In this paper, we propose a model driven approach to semi-automatic configuration of fault tolerance solutions. At design time, a set of reusable fault tolerance solutions are modeled as architecture styles, with the key properties verified by model checking. At runtime, the runtime software architecture of the target system is automatically constructed by the code generated from the given architectural meta-model. Then, the impact of each component on the system reliability is automatically analyzed to recommend which components should be considered in the fault tolerance configuration. Finally, after which components are guaranteed by what fault tolerance solution is decided by the system administration, the architecture model is automatically changed by merging with the selected fault tolerance styles and finally, these changes are automatically propagated to the target system. This approach is evaluated on Java enterprise systems.	component-based system;  dynamic configuration;  fault tolerance;  mode driven approach;  software architecture	Wu, Yihan; Huang, Gang; Song, Hui; Zhang, Ying	MODELS'12: Proceedings of the 15th international conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems	https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-33666-9_33		514-530	"@inproceedings{10.1007/978-3-642-33666-9_33,

1051	ModelingAssist	MDD vs. traditional software development: A practitioner's subjective perspective	Context: Today's project managers have a myriad of methods to choose from for the development of software applications. However, they lack empirical data about the character of these methods in terms of usefulness, ease of use or compatibility, all of these being relevant variables to assess the developer's intention to use them.Objective: To compare three methods, each following a different paradigm (Model-Driven, Model-Based and Code-Centric) with respect to their adoption potential by junior software developers engaged in the development of the business layer of a Web 2.0 application.Method: We have conducted a quasi-experiment with 26 graduate students of the University of Alicante. The application developed was a Social Network, which was organized around a fixed set of modules. Three of them, similar in complexity, were used for the experiment. Subjects were asked to use a different method for each module, and then to answer a questionnaire that gathered their perceptions during such use.Results: The results show that the Model-Driven method is regarded as the most useful, although it is also considered the least compatible with previous developers' experiences. They also show that junior software developers feel comfortable with the use of models, and that they are likely to use them if the models are accompanied by a Model-Driven development environment.Conclusions: Despite their relatively low level of compatibility, Model-Driven development methods seem to show a great potential for adoption. That said, however, further experimentation is needed to make it possible to generalize the results to a different population, different methods, other languages and tools, different domains or different application sizes.

1163	ModelingAssist	Critical Success Factors to Improve the Game Development Process from a Developer's Perspective	The growth of the software game development industry is enormous and is gaining importance day by day. This growth imposes severe pressure and a number of issues and challenges on the game development community. Game development is a complex process, and one important game development choice is to consider the developer's perspective to produce good-quality software games by improving the game development process. The objective of this study is to provide a better understanding of the developer's dimension as a factor in software game success. It focuses mainly on an empirical investigation of the effect of key developer's factors on the software game development process and eventually on the quality of the resulting game. A quantitative survey was developed and conducted to identify key developer's factors for an enhanced game development process. For this study, the developed survey was used to test the research model and hypotheses. The results provide evidence that game development organizations must deal with multiple key factors to remain competitive and to handle high pressure in the software game industry. The main contribution of this paper is to investigate empirically the influence of key developer's factors on the game development process.	developer's perspective; software game; empirical investigation; good-quality game; game development process; game developer's factor	Aleem, Saiqa; Capretz, Luiz Fernando; Ahmed, Faheem	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11390-016-1673-z		925-950		Excluded	ConflictExcluded	new_screen		E1: The proposal’s main contribution is not to assist users during modelling in MDSE tools.

1168	ModelingAssist	A model-driven engineering approach to simulation experiment design and execution	There is an increasing awareness of the added value that efficient design of experiments can provide to simulation studies. However, many practitioners lack the proper training required to design, execute and analyze a well-designed simulation experiment. In this study, we present the initial stages of a model-driven engineering based tool for managing simulation experiments. Underlying our approach are an experiment ontology and a feature model that capture the statistical design of experiments expert knowledge which users might be lacking. In its current state, the tool provides support for the design and execution of simple experiments. Using a web-based interface, the user is guided through an experiment design wizard that produces an experiment model that can be exported as an XML file containing the experiment's description. This XML can be used to synthesize scripts that can be run by a simulator and shared across different platforms.

1910	ModelingAssist	Example-based validation of domain-specific visual languages	The definition of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) is a recurrent activity in Model-Driven Engineering. However, their construction is many times an ad-hoc process, partly due to the lack of tools enabling a proper engineering of DSLs and promoting domain experts to play an active role. The focus of this paper is on the validation of meta-models for visual DSLs. For this purpose, we propose a language and tool support for describing properties that instances of meta-models should (or should not) meet. Then, our system uses a model finder to produce example models, enriched with a graphical concrete syntax, that confirm or refute the assumptions of the meta-model developer. Our language complements metaBest, a framework for the validation and verification of meta-models that includes two other languages for unit testing and specification-based testing of meta-models. A salient feature of our approach is that it fosters interaction with domain experts by the use, processing and creation of informal drawings constructed in editors liked yED or Dia. We assess the usefulness of the approach in the validation of a DSL for house blueprints, with the participation of 26 4th year computer science students.
