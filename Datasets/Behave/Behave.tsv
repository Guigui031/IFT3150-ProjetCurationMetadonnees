0	Behave	On the understanding of BDD scenarios’ quality: Preliminary practitioners’ opinions	[Context & Motivation] In agile development, acceptance tests are written to express the details from the conversations between customers and developers. One of the formats to express those details is BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) scenarios, which use a ubiquitous language, one that business and technical people can understand, to build an executable specification that represents a system behavior. [Question/Problem] Problems caused by bad documentation are known to cause project failure and we believe those problems apply to documentation in the format of acceptance tests as well. Thus, in the long-term, we seek to understand what would be the definition of a good BDD scenario and the criteria to define it. [Principal idea/results] To achieve that, we previously identified known requirements’ quality attributes that would be suitable to evaluate BDD scenarios’ quality. Based on that list of attributes, we now aim to validate that list with practitioners, identify their interpretation of the listed attributes, and uncover general recommendations to write BDD scenarios. [Contribution] Preliminary results from our initial set of interviews revealed practitioners’ interpretations for consistent, testable, valuable, understandable, and unambiguous attributes and some recommendations to write good BDD scenarios, such as the use of declarative form of writing. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

2	Behave	Enhancing the Student Learning Experience by Adopting TDD and BDD in Course Projects	A demonstration of the application and contribution of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) in the student learning experience in the context of a Software Engineering course. Background: Software testing is an activity for ensuring software quality. Although teaching testing rigorously to students is a priority in academia, undergraduate students often encounter difficulties performing testing tasks effectively. Intended Outcomes: To increase satisfaction rate and course grades, and reduce delivery time. Application Design: We experimented with the Software Engineering Laboratory (LES) course of a Private University in the Bachelor of Computer Science and Information Systems courses. This experiment corroborated the learning difficulties of students. Collected data were assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Findings: Backed up with statistical tests, the results showed a reduction in student absences, higher student satisfaction rate, and higher grades in the courses. Furthermore, our approach allowed students to deliver a product in a short period, representing a possibility of adoption of BDD due to their successful learning experience. Finally, we aim to foster a discussion of appropriate teaching methods of software testing.

3	Behave	How to Evaluate BDD Scenarios' Quality?	A scenario from the Behavior-driven development (BDD) practice is a known format to represent acceptance tests in agile methodologies, communicating assumptions and expectations by expressing the details that result from the conversations between customers and developers. We believe that this formalization of behavior need to be of good quality to avoid known requirement problems that arise from bad documentation, such as incomplete, underspecified and inconsistent requirements. However, there are only informal guidelines to guide practitioners on their BDD scenarios' elaboration and quality evaluations. To address this lack of guidance, we define a set of quality attributes and propose a question-based checklist to assist BDD scenarios' quality evaluations. [Methods] The quality attributes were identified from an interview-based study with 18 practitioners. In this study, practitioners shared their interpretations on an initial set of literature-informed quality attributes and their own personal evaluation criteria. We consolidated both in a single list of newly redefined attributes, used in the definition of our proposed checklist. We believe that our newly re-defined quality attributes and question-based checklist can enhance the existing guidelines and practitioners' ability to evaluate BDD scenario's quality by providing them with an standard guideline for scenarios' refinement conversations.	behavior-driven development; checklist; documentation; empirical study; quality	Gabriel Oliveira; Sabrina Marczak; Cassiano Moralles	SBES '19: Proceedings of the XXXIII Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering	https://doi.org/10.1145/3350768.3351301		481-490		Included	Included	new_screen			2	ACM		How to Evaluate BDD Scenarios' Quality?	https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3350768.3351301	Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex
4	Behave	Implementing behavior driven development in an open source ERP	A typical problem in Software Engineering is how to guarantee that all system's requirements are correctly implemented through source code. Traditionally, requirement tracing is a manual task comprised of keeping links from requirements to source code, going through different modeling artifacts, including models. However, these techniques cannot guarantee that requirements are always correctly implemented by source code. Aiming at solving this problem, Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a specification technique that automatically checks if all functional requirements are treated properly by source code through the connection of the textual description of requirements to automated tests. Given that for Enterprise Information Systems, requirements are usually identified by analyzing business process models, and these processes are implemented through workflows, connecting workflows to automated tests through BDD specifications can provide automated requirements traceability. The aim of this paper is to briefly present this proposal and show how it was implemented for the open source ERP5 system. © 2013 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

5	Behave	Business Language Driven Development: Joining business process models to automated tests	A typical problem in Software Engineering is how to guarantee that every system requirement is correctly implemented by source code. Many techniques were proposed, mostly based on taking notes of relationships between requirements and code in modeling and documenting artifacts. However, these techniques cannot guarantee that the artifacts are always synchronized with source code. Aiming at solving this problem, Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a specification technique that automatically checks that all functional requirements are treated properly by source code, through connecting the textual description of requirements to automated tests. Nevertheless, in some software development areas, such as Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), requirements are usually identified by analyzing business process models - which use graphical notations of the underlying processes logic. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to present Business Language Driven Development (BLDD), a method that aims to extend BDD, by connecting business process models directly to automated tests, thus guaranteeing that requirements are properly covered by code. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

6	Behave	Test Automation Using Selenium Webdriver 3.0 with C#	About the Book Test Automation using Selenium WebDriver with C#, is the latest book released on Selenium 3.0 using C# as a programming language. This Selenium book has been designed with the objectives of simplicity and ease of understanding. After the huge success of author Vaibhav Mittal and Navneesh Gargs Test Automation books on Selenium with Java, UFT and Microsoft Coded UI this book follows a similar step by step approach to Install, configure and design automation framework using Selenium WebDriver using Visual Studio 2017 and its components. Who is this book for? This book is recommended both for those who are beginning to learn test automation (using Selenium WebDriver) and for advanced automation users. It follows a unique training based approach instead of a regular textbook approach. Using a step by step approach, it guides the students through the exercises using pictorial snapshots. It includes many practical examples and issues which most of the automation testers encounter in day-to-day automation. These experiences will give you an insight into what challenges you could face with automation in the real world. Practical examples cover how to use most of the features within Selenium WebDriver using Visual Studio 2017. No Programming Background? A major fear amongst functional testers who want to learn Selenium is of programming language and coding. As a part of this, we will cover just enough basics of C# programming language that will give the readers the confidence to use Selenium WebDriver. Integrations Covered This book covers Selenium Webdriver integration with independent components to be installed like Microsoft Visual Studio 2017, Katalon, Extent Report, VSTS (Continuous Integration tool) and Specflow (Behaviour Driven Development). We will cover step by step installation, configuration and use of each of these components. Those want to know about Cross Browser testing, it covers how to use Selenium WebDriver to run on IE, Firefox and Chrome browsers. It also covers aspects of Continuous Integration tool from Microsoft (VSTS) so that Selenium WebDriver scripts can be integrated with the development environment and run on nightly builds.

7	Behave	Bridging the Gap between Requirements Modeling and Behavior-Driven Development	Acceptance criteria (AC) are implementation agnostic conditions that a system must meet to be consistent with its requirements and be accepted by its stakeholders. Each acceptance criterion is typically expressed as a natural-language statement with a clear pass or fail outcome. Writing AC is a tedious and error-prone activity, especially when the requirements specifications evolve and there are different analysts and testing teams involved. Analysts and testers must iterate multiple times to ensure that AC are understandable and feasible, and accurately address the most important requirements and workflows of the system being developed. In many cases, analysts express requirements through models, along with natural language, typically in some variant of the UML. AC must then be derived by developers and testers from such models. In this paper, we bridge the gap between requirements models and AC by providing a UML-based modeling methodology and an automated solution to generate AC. We target AC in the form of Behavioral Specifications in the context of Behavioral-Driven Development (BDD), a widely used agile practice in many application domains. More specially we target the well-known Gherkin language to express AC, which then can be used to generate executable test cases. We evaluate our modeling methodology and AC generation solution through an industrial case study in the financial domain. Our results suggest that (1) our methodology is feasible to apply in practice, and (2) the additional modeling effort required by our methodology is outweighed by the benefits the methodology brings in terms of automated and systematic AC generation and improved model precision.

8	Behave	Design and validation of a C++ code generator from Abstract State Machines specifications	According to best practices of model-driven engineering, the implementation of a system should be obtained from its model through a systematic model-to-code transformation. We present in this paper a methodology supported by the Asm2C++ tool, which allows the users to generate C++ code from abstract state machine models. Thanks to Asm2C++, the implementation is generated in a seamless manner with an assurance of potential bug freeness of the generated code. Following the same approach, model-based testing suggests deriving also (unit) tests from abstract models. We extend the Asm2C++ tool such that it can automatically produce unit tests for the generated code. Abstract test sequences, either generated randomly or through model checking, are translated to concrete C++ unit tests using the Boost library. In a similar manner, also, scenarios are generated in a behavior-driven development (BDD) approach. To guarantee the correctness of the transformation process, we define a mechanism to test the correctness of the model-to-code transformation with respect to two main criteria: syntactical correctness and semantic correctness, which is based on the definition of conformance between the specification and the code. Using this approach, we have devised a process able to test the generated code by reusing unit tests. The process has been used to validate our model-to-code transformations. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.		Bonfanti S., Gargantini A., Mashkoor A.

10	Behave	The new Y Chromosome Haplotype Reference Database	After opening the first version of an internet-accessible worldwide reference database of Y chromosome profiles 14 years ago and six years after the last major relaunch the new YHRD 4.0 repository and website has been rolled-out. By November 2014 about 136k 9-locus haplotypes, among these 84k 17-locus haplotypes, 25k 23-locus haplotypes and 15k Y SNP profiles from 917 sampling locations in 128 countries have been submitted by more than 250 institutes and laboratories. In geographic terms, about 39% of the YHRD samples are from Europe, 32% from Asia, 16% from South America, 6% from North America, 4% from Africa and 2% from Oceania/Australia. Worldwide collaboration is the driving force for the rapid growth of the database and this, in turn, allows the evaluation and implementation of enhanced interpretation tools (variable frequency estimators, LR-based mixture and kinship analysis, Y-SNP-based ancestry assessment).

12	Behave	Behavior-driven development benefits and challenges:reports from an industrial study	Agile approaches arose as a way of addressing some of the main challenges in software development, such as changing requirements, lack of understanding about the system scope, and out-of-sync between code, requirements, and documentation. Studies show that agile projects still suffer from lack of customer support, resulting in difficulties to represent customer needs on requested features. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) brings a structured way to represent user behaviors and to validate user stories by using an ubiquitous language, shared among everyone involved on the development of the software. The approach allows the creation of scenarios that can be used by the team to share information between different stakeholders, enabling all those players to successfully collaborate and coordinate their work. In this paper, we report on an empirical study conducted with 24 IT professionals with practical experience on BDD. Through this, we identify the perceived benefits and challenges of adopting BDD.	agile development; behavior-driven development; empirical study; grounded theory	Lauriane Pereira; Helen Sharp; Cleidson de Souza; Gabriel Oliveira; Sabrina Marczak; Ricardo Bastos	XP '18: Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Agile Software Development: Companion	https://doi.org/10.1145/3234152.3234167		1-4		Included	Included	new_screen			2	ACM		Behavior-Driven Development Benefits and Challenges: Reports from an Industrial Study		Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
13	Behave	Legend: an agile DSL toolset for web acceptance testing	Agile development emphasizes collaborations among customers, business analysts, domain experts, developers, and testers. However, the large scale and rapid pace of many agile projects presents challenges during testing activities. Large sets of test artifacts must be comprehensible and available to various stakeholders, traceable to requirements, and easily maintainable as the software evolves. In this paper we describe Legend, a toolset that leverages domain-specific language to streamline functional testing in agile projects. Some key features of the toolset include test template generation from user stories, model-based automation, test inventory synchronization, and centralized test tagging.

16	Behave	Identifying critical areas for improvement in agile multi-site co-development	Agile processes potentially ease distributed software development by demanding regular communication and self-management of virtual team members. However, being designed for collocated teams, extensions to the regular process need to be made. We investigate critical areas of improvement based on a case of distributed Scrum involving two unaffiliated Austrian IT organizations that collaborate to build software. We identified eight critical areas for improvement originating from interviews, retrospective meetings and an in-depth case analysis. Key suggestions for practice include the establishment of long-lived single-site Scrum teams and the application of Behavior Driven Development (BDD) to make implicit requirement knowledge explicit and transparent to all of the distributed parties.

17	Behave	Quality of software requirements specification in agile projects: A cross-case analysis of six companies	Agile Software Development (ASD) has several limitations concerning its requirements engineering activities. Improving the quality of Software Requirements Specifications (SRSs) in ASD may help to gain a competitive advantage in the software industry. Based on the findings of a Systematic Mapping study, six industrial case studies in different contexts were conducted to investigate and characterize the requirements specification activity in ASD. Data collected from documents, observations, and interviews with software engineers were triangulated, analyzed, and synthesized using Grounded Theory and Meta-Ethnography. The analysis and cross-synthesis of the six case studies resulted in a model describing the phenomenon. This model defines the simplicity and objectivity as essential quality factors of SRSs in ASD. The main factors that affect the SRSs quality in ASD projects are related to their customer-driven nature that leads to prolix SRSs, hindering its understanding from the developer perspective. The emerged model is supported by explanations and provides a deeper understanding of the requirements specification activity in ASD. This creates opportunities for further studies and improvements in SRSs for ASD in industry.

18	Behave	Assessing The Effectiveness Of Test-Driven Development and Behavior-Driven Development in an Industry Setting	Agile software development deviates from the traditional and plan-based approaches to software engineering as its iterative cycles embrace changes in software requirements. Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) are techniques that have been recently adopted by the software industry and have evolved from agile practices. These techniques aim at improving both the quality of the delivered software and the developers' productivity. They are several studies that have been conducted on TDD in both academic and industry settings with however only a few on BDD. While TDD and BDD have both become popular, many organizations and developers still do not understand the differences between these concepts or where they overlap. The aim of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of these two approaches in terms of external code quality, internal code quality and developers' productivity. To understand the weaknesses and strengths of each of these methods, a literature review was first performed. An experiment was then carried out in an industry setting to observe the effectiveness of TDD and BDD on a number of subjects. Our results showed that both techniques indeed increased the external quality of the delivered product. However, a decrease in productivity and internal quality were noted when BDD was used compared to TDD which might be due to the additional steps involved in BDD.

19	Behave	The effect of Test-Driven Development and Behavior-Driven Development on Project Success Factors: A Systematic Literature Review Based Study	Agile testing approaches test-driven development (TDD), behavior-driven development (BDD); have gained popularity since the introduction of agile practices. The concept of using these approaches in software projects is to help projects succeed. The effect of TDD and BDD on Project success factors namely, cost, time, and customer satisfaction/external quality, remains an area of investigation. Therefore, this study investigates the results of previously published articles on the effect of TDD and BDD on project success factors. A systematic literature review has been conducted considering articles published between 1999 up to 2020. Thirty-one studies were selected and analyzed. 74.1% of studies are experiments, 25.8% are case studies. 67.7% of these studies were performed in an industrial setting, 29.0% were performed in an academic setting and only one study with 3.22% was mixed academic and industrial settings. The result shows that the TDD and the BDD consume more time and cost compared to traditional testing (TLD). Moreover, the TDD as TLD may not necessarily satisfy the customer unlike the BDD appears that achieve customer satisfaction. Although, when TDD compared to BDD, TDD consumed more time and lower customer acceptance than the BDD.

We adapted Behavior Driven Development (BDD) to testing activities applied to Telescope Calibration (TELCAL) software. BDD is an agile technique that encourages communication between roles by defining test cases using natural language to specify features and scenarios, what allows participants to share a common language and provides a high level set of automated tests. This work describes how we implemented and maintain BDD testing for TELCAL, the infrastructure needed to support it and proposals to expand this technique to other subsystems. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

21	Behave	Behavior-Driven Requirements Traceability via Automated Acceptance Tests	Although information retrieval advances significantly improved automated traceability tools, their accuracy is still far from 100% and therefore they still need human intervention. Furthermore, despite the demonstrated benefits of traceability, many practitioners find the overhead for its creation and maintenance too high. We propose the Behavior Driven Traceability Method (BDT) that takes a different standpoint on automated traceability: we establish ubiquitous traceability between user story requirements and source code by taking advantage of the automated acceptance tests that are created as part of the Behavior Driven Development process.

In order to formalize integration tests procedures dedicated to each system with domain specific languages approved by testers, and in order to automatize integration tests, we have introduced agile practices in the integration testing phase. We have chosen a Behavior Driven Development (BDD) approach to orchestrate Domain Specific Test Languages produced for the ACOVAS FUI project.		R. Bussenot; H. Leblanc; C.

24	Behave	Smells in software test code: A survey of knowledge in industry and academia	As a type of anti-pattern, test smells are defined as poorly designed tests and their presence may negatively affect the quality of test suites and production code. Test smells are the subject of active discussions among practitioners and researchers, and various guidelines to handle smells are constantly offered for smell prevention, smell detection, and smell correction. Since there is a vast grey literature as well as a large body of research studies in this domain, it is not practical for practitioners and researchers to locate and synthesize such a large literature. Motivated by the above need and to find out what we, as the community, know about smells in test code, we conducted a ‘multivocal’ literature mapping (classification) on both the scientific literature and also practitioners’ grey literature. By surveying all the sources on test smells in both industry (120 sources) and academia (46 sources), 166 sources in total, our review presents the largest catalogue of test smells, along with the summary of guidelines/techniques and the tools to deal with those smells. This article aims to benefit the readers (both practitioners and researchers) by serving as an “index” to the vast body of knowledge in this important area, and by helping them develop high-quality test scripts, and minimize occurrences of test smells and their negative consequences in large test automation projects.

25	Behave	Omni-script: Device independent user interface development for omni-channel fintech applications	As the number of devices and platforms gradually increased that serve as a medium for online banking services, the number of replicated services for different platforms also increase. Each service has a different representation in a different platform even though targeting the same business objectives. This situation results in the problem of re-developing similar set of requirements for different devices and services which in turn results in multiplied effort in software development and degradation in the software quality because of the replicated code. The objective of this paper is to present a device independent user interface development approach that eliminates the replicated user interface development effort of the same set of services for different platforms/devices while increasing the presentation performance. In this context, we provide a basic technique that uses a json based user interface definition format, called omni-script, to separate the representation of banking services in different platforms/devices, so called channels. Omni-script is a pioneering solution being used in a real development environment in banking software domain that is experiencing a shift towards omni-channel user experience, where users are able to seamlessly continue using banking services in different platforms and devices. As the evaluation method, we have measured the actual development effort on a representative sample development team and a set of services. Additionally, we later deployed and measured the rendering time and the amount of data communication for the proposed approach in a real production environment. Production deployment resulted in a remarkable decrease in data communication and in loading times at the client side. As importantly, the proposed approach also resulted in a nearly 75% decrease in service development time by enabling analysts to produce user interface prototypes that can be integrated to service development with minimal effort.

26	Behave	Validating enterprise architecture using ontology-based approach: A case study of student internship programme	As the practice of Enterprise Architecture (EA) diversifies, the schematic management of its objects, semantics and relationship continues to be complex. Given that EA provides support for the IT environment by simulating alignment between dynamic business architectures, heterogeneous application systems and incongruent technologies, the need to ensure validation of conceptualized EA models has become also critical. As a relatively new discipline, its disparate and widespread methodologies makes it even more challenging to adopt a generic approach in which models can be verified sequel to the unavailability of unified EA modelling languages able to describe a wide range of Information Technology domains. This paper seeks to present an approach for addressing this challenge through the use of ontologies and queries based on constraints specified in the model's motivation taxonomy. The paper is experimental research-based and grounds its hypothesis on initial model created using the ArchiMate modelling language. By transforming its conceptual metamodel into a model instance, a process which can be achieved irrespective of the modeling language used in the design of the EA, it represents extracted triples as resource description framework schema (RDFS) by mapping the model artefacts directly into classes and slots using a more conventional web ontology language. The generated RDF is then queried using Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) adopting the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) concept. A case study of the Student Internship Program (SIP) is deployed to translate information from business needs to IT solutions encapsulating a view of abstraction of the EA. The paper also proposes an implementation of the approach using an open source platform that allows construction of domain models and knowledge-based applications with ontologies and is a contribution towards effective validation of EA through taxonomy decomposition, systematic generation of testable EA artifacts, creation of structural triples of model elements and alignment of motivational goals to business behavior specifications.

"Authentication is a critical security feature for confirming the identity of a system's users, typically implemented with help from frameworks like Spring Security. It is a complex feature which should be robustly tested at all stages of development. Unit testing is an effective technique for fine-grained verification of feature behaviors that is not widely-used to test authentication. Part of the problem is that resources to help developers unit test security features are limited. Most security testing guides recommend test cases in a ""black box"" or penetration testing perspective. These resources are not easily applicable to developers writing new unit tests, or who want a security-focused perspective on coverage."

28	Behave	XUnit Test Patterns: Refactoring Test Code	"Automated testing is a cornerstone of agile development. An effective testing strategy will deliver new functionality more aggressively, accelerate user feedback, and improve quality. However, for many developers, creating effective automated tests is a unique and unfamiliar challenge.xUnit Test Patterns is the definitive guide to writing automated tests using xUnit, the most popular unit testing framework in use today. Agile coach and test automation expert Gerard Meszaros describes 68 proven patterns for making tests easier to write, understand, and maintain. He then shows you how to make them more robust and repeatable–and far more cost-effective.Loaded with information, this book feels like three books in one. The first part is a detailed tutorial on test automation that covers everything from test strategy to in-depth test coding. The second part, a catalog of 18 frequently encountered ""test smells,"" provides trouble-shooting guidelines to help you determine the root cause of problems and the most applicable patterns. The third part contains detailed descriptions of each pattern, including refactoring instructions illustrated by extensive code samples in multiple programming languages.Topics covered include Writing better tests–and writing them faster The four phases of automated tests: fixture setup, exercising the system under test, result verification, and fixture teardown Improving test coverage by isolating software from its environment using Test Stubs and Mock Objects Designing software for greater testability Using test ""smells"" (including code smells, behavior smells, and project smells) to spot problems and know when and how to eliminate them Refactoring tests for greater simplicity, robustness, and execution speedThis book will benefit developers, managers, and testers working with any agile or conventional development process, whether doing test-driven development or writing the tests last. While the patterns and smells are especially applicable to all members of the xUnit family, they also apply to next-generation behavior-driven development frameworks such as RSpec and JBehave and to other kinds of test automation tools, including recorded test tools and data-driven test tools such as Fit and FitNesse.Visual Summary of the Pattern Languageï Foreword Preface Acknowledgments Introduction Refactoring a TestPART I: The Narratives Chapter 1 A Brief Tour Chapter 2 Test Smells Chapter 3 Goals of Test Automation Chapter 4 Philosophy of Test Automation Chapter 5 Principles of Test Automation Chapter 6 Test Automation Strategy Chapter 7 xUnit Basics Chapter 8 Transient Fixture Management Chapter 9 Persistent Fixture Management Chapter 10 Result Verification Chapter 11 Using Test Doubles Chapter 12 Organizing Our Tests Chapter 13 Testing with Databases Chapter 14 A Roadmap to Effective Test Automation PART II: The Test Smellsï Chapter 15 Code Smells Chapter 16 Behavior Smells Chapter 17 Project Smells PART III: The Patternsï Chapter 18 Test Strategy Patterns Chapter 19 xUnit Basics Patterns Chapter 20 Fixture Setup Patterns Chapter 21 Result Verification Patterns Chapter 22 Fixture Teardown Patterns Chapter 23 Test Double Patterns Chapter 24 Test Organization Patterns Chapter 25 Database Patterns Chapter 26 Design-for-Testability Patterns Chapter 27 Value Patterns PART IV: Appendixes Appendix A Test Refactorings ï Appendix B xUnit Terminologyï Appendix C xUnit Family Members Appendix D Tools Appendix E Goals and Principles Appendix F Smells, Aliases, and Causes Appendix G Patterns, Aliases, and Variations Glossary Referencesï Indexï"		Meszaros, Gerard						Excluded	Excluded	new_screen			2

32	Behave	Predicting co-changes between functionality specifications and source code in behavior driven development	Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is an agile approach that uses.featurefiles to describe the functionalities of a software system using natural language constructs (English-like phrases). Because of the English-like structure of.featurefiles, BDD specifications become an evolving documentation that helps all (even non-technical) stakeholders to understand and contribute to a software project. After specifying a.featurefiles, developers can use a BDD tool (e.g., Cucumber) to automatically generate test cases and implement the code of the specified functionality. However, maintaining traceability between.featurefiles and source code requires human efforts. Therefore,.featurefiles can be out-of-date, reducing the advantages of using BDD. Furthermore, existing research do not attempt to improve the traceability between.featurefiles and source code files. In this paper, we study the co-changes between.featurefiles and source code files to improve the traceability between.featurefiles and source code files. Due to the English-like syntax of.featurefiles, we use natural language processing to identify co-changes, with an accuracy of 79%. We study the characteristics of BDD co-changes and build random forest models to predict when a.featurefiles should be modified before committing a code change. The random forest model obtains an AUC of 0.77. The model can assist developers in identifying when a.featurefiles should be modified in code commits. Once the traceability is up-to-date, BDD developers can write test code more efficiently and keep the software documentation up-to-date.	behavior driven development; co-changes; empirical software engineering; traceability	Aidan Z.

34	Behave	A model-driven approach for behavior-driven GUI testing	Behavior-driven development (BDD) brings requirement specifications and their test cases closer together by using a ubiquitous language to describe requirements that are automatically mapped to test methods. Although industry-proven tools support this automated requirement mapping, the test methods need to be implemented manually. The approach presented in this paper transforms BDD-like requirement specifications and low fidelity graphical user interface (GUI) descriptions in the format of wireframes into automatically executable graphical user interface test cases. The requirement descriptions are defined in a domain-specific language (DSL) that obeys the rules of the ubiquitous language enhanced by references to screens and widgets in a graphical user interface model. The paper reports on a controlled AB/BA crossover experiment comparing the efficiency of our approach to the industry-proven JBehave tooling. The results show that the introduced approach on average takes 63% less time to specify automated tests and thereby diminishes the problem of graphical user interface test cases being expensive to write. The experimental results were supported by experience made applying the approach in three differently sized components at a large Swiss bank.

35	Behave	Evaluating the usage of predefined interactive behaviors for writing user stories: an empirical study with potential product owners	Behavior-driven development (BDD) has gained popularity in agile software development as a means of specifying user requirements through user stories and scenarios for interactive systems under construction. Templates for guiding the writing of such stories are widely employed and can be helpful to ensure that consistent information about the requirements is provided. With the aim of getting preliminary results about how product owners (POs) write their own user stories under a predefined template, we conducted a case study with potential POs at the department in charge of business trips in a French research institute. The participants were invited to write their own user stories to describe a feature they are used to perform. The resultant stories have been analyzed to check their adherence to a template including common interactive behaviors defined by an ontology for interactive systems. Although the participants have followed different specification strategies, we observed an overall high level of adherence to the proposed template (62.26%). The results also pointed out to a wide use of domain-dependent behaviors, with the interactive behaviors defined by the ontology being, to some extent, reproduced by the participants even without prior training in the adopted vocabulary. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

Thus, there is the need to define what would be a ""good"" BDD scenario and how to evaluate scenarios. On this research design paper, we describe a study designed to understand how known quality attributes from other types of requirements specifications (like use cases or user stories) can be used with BDD scenarios. We also report our preliminary findings after performing it with novice evaluators. Those findings indicate that some of those attributes can be used to support BDD scenarios assessments."	documentation quality;documentation evaluation;behavior-driven development;empirical study	G.

37	Behave	On the applicability of BDD in a Business Intelligence project:experience report	Behavior-driven development (BDD) is a software development technique that in order to succeed relies heavily on the definition of clear acceptance criteria by software developers in the form of behavioral scenarios, later translated into acceptance tests. The adoption of BDD in Business Intelligence (BI) projects requires developers to have a broad acquaintance to business that often even customers themselves do not possess. This article presents an experience report on the use of BDD in the development of a large public health related BI project. Experience suggests that the use of BDD may not be appropriate for BI projects, especially during the early stages of development, when there is still insufficient clarity about business acceptance criteria. The need for broad maturity towards business understanding makes it complex to adopt the behavioral approach within the development process in projects of this nature.

38	Behave	BHive: Behavior-Driven development meets B-Method	Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is an “outside-in” approach to software development built upon semi-formal mediums for specifying the behavior of a system as it would be observed externally. Through the representation of a system as a collection of user stories and scenarios using BDD’s notation, practitioners automate acceptance tests using examples of desired behavior for the envisioned system. A formal model created in concert with BDD tests would provide valuable insight into test validity and enhance the visibility of the problem domain. This work called BHive builds upon the formal underpinnings of BDD scenarios by mapping their “Given,” “When,” and “Then” statements to “Precondition,” “Command,” and “Postcondition” constructs as introduced by Floyd-Hoare logic. We posit that this mapping allows for a B-Method representation to be created and that such a model is useful for exploring system behavior and exposing gaps in requirements and test plans. In this extension of previous work, we outline recent additions to BDD tooling required for the described integration, present a new strategy for test case generation from our approach, and expand on the benefits of the BHive approach to integrating formalism within a BDD project. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.

39	Behave	Automatically generating tests from natural language descriptions of software behavior	"Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is an emerging agile development approach where all stakeholders (including developers and customers) work together to write user stories in structured natural language to capture a software application's functionality in terms of required ""behaviors."" Developers can then manually write ""glue"" code so that these scenarios can be translated into executable software tests. This glue code represents individual steps within unit and acceptance test cases, and tools exist that automate the mapping from scenario descriptions to manually written code steps (typically using regular expressions). This paper takes the position that, instead of requiring programmers to write manual glue code, it is practical to convert natural language scenario descriptions into executable software tests fully automatically. To show feasibility, this paper presents preliminary results from a tool called Kirby that uses natural language processing techniques to automatically generate executable software tests from structured English scenario descriptions. Kirby relieves the developer from the laborious work of writing code for the individual steps described in scenarios, so that both developers and customers can both focus on the scenarios as pure behavior descriptions (understandable to all, not just programmers).

40	Behave	On the Understanding of How to Measure the Benefits of Behavior-Driven Development Adoption: Preliminary Literature Results from a Grey Literature Study	Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is the integration of a ubiquitous language with Test-Driven Development and Automated Testing. From this integration, BDD supports software teams to build and deliver software. Although the perceived arguments of better results and of a more efficient development process, we still have no consolidated evidence of such benefits and how to measure them. Therefore, this long-term research aims to characterize how BDD adoption benefits can be measured. To do so, our research design includes a Multivocal Literature Review, composed of a Grey Literature to explore how industry tackles the topic and a Systematic Review to gather scientific evidences, followed of a Snowballing Review to supplement the search. Next, we will conduct empirical studies to characterize the topic from practice. This paper introduces our research and presents the results from our exploratory Grey Literature. We learned from these preliminary results that there are no models or frameworks defined to measure BDD adoption benefits but that teams indeed perceive improvements in software quality, communication, rework rates, among others. We also found that these teams also perceive that team engagement improves with the adoption of BDD and that although there is a certain cost (e.g., time and financial) involved, the investment pays off in the end. These results will inform the design of our Systematic Review and of our downstream empirical studies.

Benefits can include a richer and deeper understanding of system requirements in addition to making these requirements executable. Moreover, this technique helps guide software developers in knowing what to test as well as knowing how much to test. In this tutorial, we introduce the fundamentals of this approach, a language for expressing system behaviors, and explain how to use this technique effectively in the undergraduate computer science curriculum.

43	Behave	Behave Nicely! Automatic Generation of Code for Behaviour Driven Development Test Suites	Behaviour driven development (BDD) has gained widespread use in the software industry. System specifications can be expressed as test scenarios, describing the circumstances, actions and expected outcomes. These scenarios are written in a structured natural language (Gherkin), with each step in the scenario associated with a corresponding step implementation function in the underlying programming language. A challenge recognised by industry is ensuring that the natural language scenarios, step implementation functions and underlying system implementation remain consistent with one another, requiring on-going maintenance effort as changes are made to a system. To address this, we have developed behave-nicely, a tool, for automatically generating step implementation functions from structured natural language steps, with the intention of eliminating the need for maintaining step implementation functions. We evaluated our approach on a sample of 20 white box and 50 black box projects using behaviour driven development, drawn from GitHub. Our results show that behave-nicely can generate step implementation functions for 80% of the white box and 17% of black box projects. We conclude that (a) there is significant potential for automating the process of code generation for BDD tests and (b) that the development of guidelines for writing tests in Gherkin would significantly improve the results. © 2019 IEEE.

44	Behave	Characterising the Quality of Behaviour Driven Development Specifications	Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) is an agile testing technique that enables software requirements to be specified as example interactions with the system, using structured natural language. While (in theory) being readable by non-technical stakeholders, the examples can also be executed against the code base to identify behaviours that are not yet correctly implemented. Writing good BDD suites, however, is challenging. A typical suite can contain hundreds of individual scenarios, that must correctly specify the system as a whole as well as individually. Despite much discussion amongst practitioners and in the blogosphere, as yet no formal definition of what makes for a high quality BDD suite has been given. To shed light on this, we surveyed BDD practitioners, asking for their opinions on the quality criteria that are important for BDD suites. We proposed, and asked for opinions on, four quality principles, and gave practitioners the option to add more principles of their own. This paper reports on the results of the survey, and presents an approach to defining BDD suite quality. © The Author(s) 2020.		Binamungu L.P., Embury S.M., Konstantinou N.

45	Behave	Behaviour-Driven Development of Foundational UML Components	Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) focuses all development activities on the delivery of behaviours - what a system should do, described such that developers and domain experts speak the same language. BDD frameworks allow users to represent the required system behaviour as executable user stories and the acceptance criteria as executable scenarios attached to user stories. In this paper we define a UML profile that allows users to create executable Foundational UML (fUML) stories and scenarios. In order to easily construct scenarios we introduce a BDD model library which contains fUML activities for testing equalities and inclusions. We also present an Eclipse-based development tool that supports a BDD approach for developing fUML components. The tool provides developers a concrete syntax for defining executable scenarios, and automatically updates the project status based on verified delivered behaviorus.	acceptance criteria; behaviour-driven development; executable specification; executable UML; user story	Lazr, Ioan; Motogna, Simona; Pírv, Bazil	Electron.

47	Behave	Empirical Findings on BDD Story Parsing to Support Consistency Assurance between Requirements and Artifacts	Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) stories have gained considerable attention in recent years as an effective way to specify and test user requirements in agile software development projects. External testing frameworks also allow developers to automate the execution of BDD stories and check whether a fully functional software system behaves as expected. However, other software artifacts may quite often lose synchronization with the stories, and many inconsistencies can arise with respect to requirements representation. This paper reports on preliminary empirical findings regarding the performance of two existing approaches in the literature intended to support consistency assurance between BDD stories and software artifacts. The first approach involves the parsing of BDD stories in order to identify conceptual elements to automatically generate consistent class diagrams, while the second approach seeks to identify interaction elements to automatically assess the consistency of task models and GUI prototypes. We report on the precision of these approaches when applied to a study with BDD stories previously written by Product Owners (POs). Based on the results, we also identify a set of challenges and opportunities for BDD stories in the consistency assurance of such artifacts.

48	Behave	Blockchain smart contracts formalization: Approaches and challenges to address vulnerabilities	Blockchain as a distributed computing platform enables users to deploy pieces of software (known as smart contracts) for a wealth of next-generation decentralized applications without involving a trusted third-party. The advantages of smart contracts do, however, come at a price. As with most technologies, there are potential security threats, vulnerabilities and various other issues associated with smart contracts. Writing secure and safe smart contracts can be extremely difficult due to various business logics, as well as platform vulnerabilities and limitations. Formal methods have recently been advocated to mitigate these vulnerabilities. This paper aims to provide a first-time study on current formalization research on all smart contract-related platforms on blockchains, which is scarce in the literature. To this end, a timely and rigorous systematic review to examine the state-of-the-art research and achievements published between 2015 and July 2019 is provided. This study is based on a comprehensive review of a set of 35 research papers that have been extracted from eight major online digital databases. The results indicate that the most common formalization technique is theorem proving, which is most often used to verify security properties relating to smart contracts, while other techniques such as symbolic execution and model checking were also frequently used. These techniques were most commonly used to verify the functional correctness of smart contracts. From the language and automation point of views, there were 12 languages (domain specific/specification/general purpose) proposed or used for the formalization of smart contracts on blockchains, while 15 formal method-specific automated tools/frameworks were identified for mitigating various vulnerabilities of smart contracts. From the results of this work, we further highlight three open issues for future research in this emerging domain including: formal testing, automated verification of smart contracts, and domain specific languages (DSLs) for Ethereum. These issues suggest the need for additional, in-depth research. Our study also provides possible future research directions.

49	Behave	Survey on blockchain based smart contracts: Applications, opportunities and challenges	Blockchain is one of the disruptive technical innovation in the recent computing paradigm. Many applications already notoriously hard and complex are fortunate to ameliorate the service with the blessings of blockchain and smart contracts. The decentralized and autonomous execution with in-built transparency of blockchain based smart contracts revolutionize most of the applications with optimum and effective functionality. The paper explores the significant applications which already benefited from the smart contracts.

End-to-end automatic business process validation can be a challenging task, but an important way to check that business rules continue to work properly and that problems are detected and corrected as soon as possible. This paper presents the design of a test automation platform, ETAP-Pro, to test end-to-end business processes that aims to overcome some challenges in validating business processes.

51	Behave	A Reusable Automated Acceptance Testing Architecture for Microservices in Behavior-Driven Development	Cloud Computing and Mobile Cloud Computing are reshaping the way applications are being developed and deployed due to their unique needs such as massive scalability, guaranteed fault tolerance, near zero downtime, etc. and also daunting challenges such as security, reliability, continuous deployment and update capability. Microservices architecture, where application is composed of a set of independently deployable services, is increasingly becoming popular due to its capability to address most of these needs and challenges. In recent years, the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) has become one of the most popular agile software development processes, and frequently used in microservices development. The key to success of BDD is the executable acceptance tests that describe the expected behavior of a feature and its acceptance criteria in the form of scenarios using simple and business people readable syntax. The reusability, auditability, and maintainability become some of the major concerns when BDD test framework is applied for each microservice repository and no previous research addresses these concerns. In this paper, we present a reusable automated acceptance testing architecture to address all these concerns.	behavior-driven development; Gherkin; executable automated acceptance testing; functional testing; microservice	Mazedur Rahman; Jerry Gao	2015 IEEE Symposium on Service-Oriented System Engineering	https://doi.org/10.1109/SOSE.2015.55				Excluded	Excluded	new_screen			2	IEEE		A Reusable Automated Acceptance Testing Architecture for Microservices in Behavior-Driven Development	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7133548	IEEE	nan; Abstract; Keywords; References; Pages; Year; Bibtex

53	Behave	Generating educational mobile applications using UIDPs identified by artificial intelligence techniques	Commercial mobile devices vary in brand, size, and functionalities, but they all allow people to interact with educational applications. In software engineering, application development techniques, approaches, methodologies, and processes (e.g., BBD, FDD, RAD, DDD) are often time consuming, costly, or aim at expert developers – which implies that users outside the software development field (e.g., teachers) need great practice to become experienced application developers. This work proposes an artificial-intelligence-based process for generating educational mobile apps from freehand-generated images. The images’ design is based on User Interface Design Pattern (UIDP) representations. As a proof of concept, we introduce EduMatic, an application development tool. To test our process, we assessed Wiki-Comp, an application built with EduMatic, along with three other external educational applications: Khan Academy, Wiki encyclopedia, and Kiwix. According to the evaluation results, Wiki-Comp outstands in functionality, usability, and performance aspects.

55	Behave	Automation Support for Mobile App Quality Assurance – A Tool Landscape	Competitive pressure in app stores, as well as direct and transparent feedback of app store reviews have resulted in an increased demand for outstanding app quality and user experience. At the same time, reduced time-to-market, decreased budgets and time available for quality assurance, and careful user experience design have to be considered. In response, an enormous market for mobile app quality and user experience measurement tools has grown around the mobile app store ecosystems. Developers following lean and agile development approaches continuously produce new features and ready-to-ship software increments. In those settings, budgets for evaluation and familiarization into new tools are very limited. Currently there are alone more than 28 tools and frameworks for functional test automation and more than 16 different device clouds available. For most of the software developing companies, it is impossible to evaluate and test all of them. In this paper, we present a classification in order to help navigation through the mobile app quality tools landscape for easier selection and more targeted evaluation of tools.

56	Behave	CIaaS - computational intelligence as a service with Athena	Computational Intelligence (CI) is a sub-branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focus on studying adaptive mechanisms to enable intelligent behavior in complex environments. CI techniques have been successful in solving complex problems in many different knowledge areas. However, despite their usefulness, developing solutions based on CI techniques is not a trivial activity, since it involves the codification/adaptation of algorithms to specific context and problems. In this paper, we present and validate through a quasi-experiment a new paradigm to develop CI-based solutions using a more mature version of Athena (2.0): Computational Intelligence as a Service (CIaaS). Using this tool, both researchers and practitioners can design and evaluate CI-based solutions by dragging and dropping components in a visual environment, in a cloud-based platform. The results of the quasi-experiment suggest that our approach can help researchers to design and evaluate CI-based systems in a simple, reliable and fast way.

57	Behave	Optimizing stock assessment workflows by applying software development methodology	Considering that stock assessment requires iterative work including exploratory calculations and discussion, efficiency in completing projects is the key to a successful contribution to stock management. However, if the production speed of each process of the project is inconsistent, a faster process may be worse than a slower process because a large amount of information produced by a faster process induces human error. To coordinate the production speed of each process, we applied software development methodology to the whole assessment project, including small important tasks such as scenario selection, debugging, and yearly updates. First, we established a continuously integrated (CI) document system that monitors project files and triggers report generation when they are updated. The system is composed of four cloud services: a code hosting service, a cloud computing service, cloud storage, and a website hosting service. Because of the CI document system, all the following iterative work was reflected in the report without creating any unused output. The workflow benefited not only from the collaboration but also from the maintainability of the project because work progress and the discussion remained visible for all collaborators. We discuss the effectiveness of a workflow by Lean manufacturing that allows us to focus on the essential problem of the assessment project.

58	Behave	Architecting with microservices: A systematic mapping study	Context A microservice architecture is composed of a set of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms. Many aspects on architecting with microservices are still unexplored and existing research is still far from being crispy clear. Objective We aim at identifying, classifying, and evaluating the state of the art on architecting with microservices from the following perspectives: publication trends, focus of research, and potential for industrial adoption. Method We apply the systematic mapping methodology. We rigorously selected 103 primary studies and we defined and applied a classification framework to them for extracting key information for subsequent analysis. We synthesized the obtained data and produced a clear overview of the state of the art. Results This work contributes with (i) a classification framework for research studies on architecting with microservices, (ii) a systematic map of current research of the field, (iii) an evaluation of the potential for industrial adoption of research results, and (iv) a discussion of emerging findings and implications for future research. Conclusion This study provides a solid, rigorous, and replicable picture of the state of the art on architecting with microservices. Its results can benefit both researchers and practitioners of the field.

59	Behave	Design from detail: Analyzing data from a global day of coderetreat	Context Coderetreats are reflective communities of practice, where participants congregate informally to apply their coding abilities to a clearly defined problem setting with the aim of developing their software design skills. One of these events is the global day of coderetreat (GDCR) involving more than two thousand software developers worldwide. Objective The GDCR provided an opportunity to explore the ways that the coderetreat activity is perceived by its participants as a medium for reflective practice, and to suggest ways that we can enhance the design of coderetreats for improving both the experience and learning outcomes. Method We conducted both quantitative and qualitative surveys from a number of participants in the GDCR to understand how software developers hone their craft in the context of a coderetreat. Results Our study indicates that future coderetreats, particularly those that are likely to attract less experienced developers, should consider providing more structural scaffolding to the initial processes of test driven development. Conclusion We believe that all coderetreats should more explicitly encourage practice and reflection on the four elements of simple design. We suggest a more sustained approach throughout the coderetreat with provision of more structural scaffolding. Accordingly, we have derived a set of recommended practices to make the coderetreat more effective for less experienced developers.

60	Behave	A multi-case study of agile requirements engineering and the use of test cases as requirements	Context It is an enigma that agile projects can succeed ‘without requirements’ when weak requirements engineering is a known cause for project failures. While agile development projects often manage well without extensive requirements test cases are commonly viewed as requirements and detailed requirements are documented as test cases. Objective We have investigated this agile practice of using test cases as requirements to understand how test cases can support the main requirements activities, and how this practice varies. Method We performed an iterative case study at three companies and collected data through 14 interviews and two focus groups. Results The use of test cases as requirements poses both benefits and challenges when eliciting, validating, verifying, and managing requirements, and when used as a documented agreement. We have identified five variants of the test-cases-as-requirements practice, namely de facto, behaviour-driven, story-test driven, stand-alone strict and stand-alone manual for which the application of the practice varies concerning the time frame of requirements documentation, the requirements format, the extent to which the test cases are a machine executable specification and the use of tools which provide specific support for the practice of using test cases as requirements. Conclusions The findings provide empirical insight into how agile development projects manage and communicate requirements. The identified variants of the practice of using test cases as requirements can be used to perform in-depth investigations into agile requirements engineering. Practitioners can use the provided recommendations as a guide in designing and improving their agile requirements practices based on project characteristics such as number of stakeholders and rate of change. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

61	Behave	NLP-assisted software testing: A systematic mapping of the literature	Context To reduce manual effort of extracting test cases from natural-language requirements, many approaches based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) have been proposed in the literature. Given the large amount of approaches in this area, and since many practitioners are eager to utilize such techniques, it is important to synthesize and provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in this area. Objective Our objective is to summarize the state-of-the-art in NLP-assisted software testing which could benefit practitioners to potentially utilize those NLP-based techniques. Moreover, this can benefit researchers in providing an overview of the research landscape. Method To address the above need, we conducted a survey in the form of a systematic literature mapping (classification). After compiling an initial pool of 95 papers, we conducted a systematic voting, and our final pool included 67 technical papers. Results This review paper provides an overview of the contribution types presented in the papers, types of NLP approaches used to assist software testing, types of required input requirements, and a review of tool support in this area. Some key results we have detected are: (1) only four of the 38 tools (11%) presented in the papers are available for download; (2) a larger ratio of the papers (30 of 67) provided a shallow exposure to the NLP aspects (almost no details). Conclusion This paper would benefit both practitioners and researchers by serving as an “index” to the body of knowledge in this area. The results could help practitioners utilizing the existing NLP-based techniques; this in turn reduces the cost of test-case design and decreases the amount of human resources spent on test activities. After sharing this review with some of our industrial collaborators, initial insights show that this review can indeed be useful and beneficial to practitioners.

62	Behave	Speed up BDD for safety verification in agile development:a partially replicated controlled experiment	Context: Agile development has aroused interest in developing safety-critical systems.Problem statement:However, an increasingly changing architecture makes traditional safety assurance, especially safety analysis and verification, difficult to work. Recently, we proposed STPA-BDD (System-Theoretic Process Analysis-Behaviour Driven Development) for safety analysis and verification in agile development. It showed a good communication effectiveness in a controlled experiment with 44 undergraduate students. However, productivity, test thoroughness and fault detection effectiveness show no statistically significant difference in comparison with UAT (User Acceptance Testing).Objective: In this article, we aim to speed up STPA-BDD through improving productivity, test thoroughness and fault detection effectiveness of STPA-BDD. We develop a semi-automated tool to speed up BDD for safety verification.Method: We evaluate the semi-automated tool concerning productivity, test thoroughness and fault detection effectiveness in a replicated experiment with 11 additional undergraduate students by comparing them with the results from 22 students in the original experiment.Results: The results turn out that productivity is more than 7 times greater, while test thoroughness is more than 1.5 times greater and fault detection effectiveness is more than 2 times greater by using this semi-automated tool than without using it.Conclusion:BDD for safety verification has beed sped up by using this semi-automated tool. Using professionals instead of students as subjects might provide a clearer impact.	agile development; controlled experiment; safety verification	Yang Wang; Daniel Ryan Degutis; Stefan Wagner	XP '18: Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Agile Software Development: Companion	https://doi.org/10.1145/3234152.3234181		1-8		Included	Included	new_screen			2	ACM		Speed up BDD for Safety Verification in Agile Development: A Partially Replicated Controlled Experiment		Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

64	Behave	Is business domain language support beneficial for creating test case specifications: A controlled experiment	Context: Behavior Driven Development (BDD), widely used in modern software development, enables easy creation of acceptance test case specifications and serves as a communication basis between business- and technical-oriented stakeholders. BDD is largely facilitated through simple domain specific languages (DSL) and usually restricted to technical test domain concepts. Integrating business domain concepts to implement a ubiquitous language for all members of the development team is an appealing test language improvement issue. But the integration of business domain concepts into BDD toolkits has so far not been investigated. Objective: The objective of the study presented in this paper is to examine whether supporting the ubiquitous language features inside a DSL, by extending a DSL with business domain concepts, is beneficial over using a DSL without those concepts. In the context of the study, benefit is measured in terms of perceived quality, creation time and length of the created test case specifications. In addition, we analyze if participants feel supported when using predefined business domain concepts. Method: We investigate the creation of test case specifications, similar to BDD, in a controlled student experiment performed with graduate students based on a novel platform for DSL experimentation. The experiment was carried out by two groups, each solving a similar comparable test case, one with the simple DSL, the other one with the DSL that includes business domain concepts. A crossover design was chosen for evaluating the perceived quality of the resulting specifications. Results: Our experiment indicates that a business domain aware language allows significant faster creation of documents without lowering the perceived quality. Subjects felt better supported by the DSL with business concepts. Conclusion: Based on our findings we propose that existing BDD toolkits could be further improved by integrating business domain concepts.

65	Behave	Supporting refactoring of BDD specifications—An empirical study	Context: Behavior-driven development (BDD) is a variant of test-driven development where specifications are described in a structured domain-specific natural language. Although refactoring is a crucial activity of BDD, little research is available on the topic. Objective: To support practitioners in refactoring BDD specifications by (1) proposing semi-automated approaches to identify refactoring candidates; (2) defining refactoring techniques for BDD specifications; and (3) evaluating the proposed identification approaches in an industry context. Method: Using Action Research, we have developed an approach for identifying refactoring candidates in BDD specifications based on two measures of similarity and applied the approach in two projects of a large software organization. The accuracy of the measures for identifying refactoring candidates was then evaluated against an approach based on machine learning and a manual approach based on practitioner perception. Results: We proposed two measures of similarity to support the identification of refactoring candidates in a BDD specification base; (1) normalized compression similarity (NCS) and (2) similarity ratio (SR). A semi-automated approach based on NCS and SR was developed and applied to two industrial cases to identify refactoring candidates. Our results show that our approach can identify candidates for refactoring 6o times faster than a manual approach. Our results furthermore showed that our measures accurately identified refactoring candidates compared with a manual identification by software practitioners and outperformed an ML-based text classification approach. We also described four types of refactoring techniques applicable to BDD specifications; merging candidates, restructuring candidates, deleting duplicates, and renaming specification titles. Conclusion: Our results show that NCS and SR can help practitioners in accurately identifying BDD specifications that are suitable candidates for refactoring, which also decreases the time for identifying refactoring candidates.

66	Behave	B-Refactoring: Automatic test code refactoring to improve dynamic analysis	Context: Developers design test suites to verify that software meets its expected behaviors. Many dynamic analysis techniques are performed on the exploitation of execution traces from test cases. In practice, one test case may imply various behaviors. However, the execution of a test case only yields one trace, which can hide the others. Objective: In this article, we propose a new technique of test code refactoring, called B-Refactoring. The idea behind B-Refactoring is to split a test case into small test fragments, which cover a simpler part of the control flow to provide better support for dynamic analysis. Method: For a given dynamic analysis technique, B-Refactoring monitors the execution of test cases and constructs small test cases without loss of the testability. We apply B-Refactoring to assist two existing analysis tasks: automatic repair of if-condition bugs and automatic analysis of exception contracts. Results: Experimental results show that B-Refactoring can effectively improve the execution traces of the test suite. Real-world bugs that could not be previously fixed with the original test suites are fixed after applying B-Refactoring; meanwhile, exception contracts are better verified via applying B-Refactoring to original test suites. Conclusions: We conclude that applying B-Refactoring improves the execution traces of test cases for dynamic analysis. This improvement can enhance existing dynamic analysis tasks.

67	Behave	Adapting Behavior Driven Development (BDD) for large-scale software systems	Context: Large-scale software projects require interaction between many stakeholders. Behavior-driven development (BDD) facilitates collaboration between stakeholders, and an adapted BDD process can help improve cooperation in a large-scale project. Objective: The objective of this study is to propose and empirically evaluate a BDD based process adapted for large-scale projects. Method: A technology transfer model was used to propose a BDD based process for large-scale projects. We conducted six workshop sessions to understand the challenges and benefits of BDD. Later, an industrial evaluation was performed for the process with the help of practitioners. Results: From our investigations, understanding of a business aspect of requirements, their improved quality, a guide to system-level use-cases, reuse of artifacts, and help for test organization are found as benefits of BDD. Practitioners identified the following challenges: specification and ownership of behaviors, adoption of new tools, the software projects’ scale, and versioning of behaviors. We proposed a process to address these challenges and evaluated the process with the help of practitioners. Conclusion: The evaluation proved that BDD could be adapted and used to facilitate interaction in large-scale software projects in the software industry. The feedback from the practitioners helped in improving the proposed process.

68	Behave	Design, monitoring, and testing of microservices systems: The practitioners’ perspective	Context: Microservices Architecture (MSA) has received significant attention in the software industry. However, little empirical evidence exists on design, monitoring, and testing of microservices systems. Objective: This research aims to gain a deep understanding of how microservices systems are designed, monitored, and tested in the industry. Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted with 106 survey responses and 6 interviews from microservices practitioners. Results: The main findings are: (1) a combination of domain-driven design and business capability is the most used strategy to decompose an application into microservices, (2) over half of the participants used architecture evaluation and architecture implementation when designing microservices systems, (3) API gateway and Backend for frontend patterns are the most used MSA patterns, (4) resource usage and load balancing as monitoring metrics, log management and exception tracking as monitoring practices are widely used, (5) unit and end-to-end testing are the most used testing strategies, and (6) the complexity of microservices systems poses challenges for their design, monitoring, and testing, for which there are no dedicated solutions. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that more research is needed to (1) deal with microservices complexity at the design level, (2) handle security in microservices systems, and (3) address the monitoring and testing challenges through dedicated solutions.

69	Behave	Big Data analytics in Agile software development: A systematic mapping study	Context: Over the last decade, Agile methods have changed the software development process in an unparalleled way and with the increasing popularity of Big Data, optimizing development cycles through data analytics is becoming a commodity. Objective: Although a myriad of research exists on software analytics as well as on Agile software development (ASD) practice on itself, there exists no systematic overview of the research done on ASD from a data analytics perspective. Therefore, the objective of this work is to make progress by linking ASD with Big Data analytics (BDA). Method: As the primary method to find relevant literature on the topic, we performed manual search and snowballing on papers published between 2011 and 2019. Results: In total, 88 primary studies were selected and analyzed. Our results show that BDA is employed throughout the whole ASD lifecycle. The results reveal that data-driven software development is focused on the following areas: code repository analytics, defects/bug fixing, testing, project management analytics, and application usage analytics. Conclusions: As BDA and ASD are fast-developing areas, improving the productivity of software development teams is one of the most important objectives BDA is facing in the industry. This study provides scholars with information about the state of software analytics research and the current trends as well as applications in the business environment. Whereas, thanks to this literature review, practitioners should be able to understand better how to obtain actionable insights from their software artifacts and on which aspects of data analytics to focus when investing in such initiatives.

70	Behave	Documentation of Quality Requirements in Agile Software Development	Context: Quality requirements (QRs) have a significant role in the success of software projects. In agile software development (ASD), where working software is valued over comprehensive documentation, QRs are often under-specified or not documented. Consequently, they may be handled improperly and result in degraded software quality and increased maintenance costs. Investigating the documentation of QRs in ASD, would provide evidence on existing practices, tools and aspects considered in ASD that other practitioners might utilize to improve documentation and management of QRs in ASD. Although there are some studies examining documentation in ASD, those that specifically investigate the documentation of QRs in depth are lacking.

Objective: We investigate, which tools are used in software delivery, what are the reasons omitting certain parts of the toolchain and what implications toolchains have on how rapidly software gets delivered to customers. Method: We present a multiple-case study of the toolchains currently in use in Finnish software-intensive organizations interested in improving their delivery frequency. We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews in 18 case organizations from various software domains. The interviewees were key representatives of their organization, considering delivery activities. Results: Commodity tools, such as version control and continuous integration, were used in almost every organization. Modestly used tools, such as UI testing and performance testing, were more distinctly missing from some organizations. Uncommon tools, such as artifact repository and acceptance testing, were used only in a minority of the organizations. Tool usage is affected by the state of current workflows, manual work and relevancy of tools. Organizations whose toolchains were more automated and contained fewer manual steps were able to deploy software more rapidly. Conclusions: There is variety in the need for tool support in different development steps as there are domain-specific differences in the goals of the case organizations. Still, a well-founded toolchain supports speedy delivery of new software.

72	Behave	Demystifying the adoption of behavior-driven development in open source projects	Context:Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) features the capability, through appropriate domain-specific languages, of specifying acceptance test cases and making them executable. The availability of frameworks such as Cucumber or RSpec makes the application of BDD possible in practice. However, it is unclear to what extent developers use such frameworks, and whether they use them for actually performing BDD, or, instead, for other purposes such as unit testing. Objective:In this paper, we conduct an empirical investigation about the use of BDD tools in open source, and how, when a BDD tool is in place, BDD specifications co-evolve with source code. Method:Our investigation includes three different phases: (i) a large-scale analysis to understand the extent to which BDD frameworks are used in 50,000 popular open-source projects written in five programming languages; (ii) a study on the co-evolution of scenarios, fixtures and production code in a sample of 20 Ruby projects, through the Granger’s causality test, and (iii) a survey with 31 developers to understand how they use BDD frameworks. Results:Results of the study indicate that  ≃  27% of the sampled projects use BDD frameworks, with a prevalence in Ruby projects (68%). In about 37% of the cases, we found a co-evolution between scenarios/fixtures and production code. Specifically, changes to scenarios and fixtures often happen together or after changes to source code. Moreover, survey respondents indicate that, while they understand the intended purpose of BDD frameworks, most of them write tests while/after coding rather than strictly applying BDD. Conclusions:Even if the BDD frameworks usage is widespread among open source projects, in many cases they are used for different purposes such as unit testing activities. This mainly happens because developers felt BDD remains quite effort-prone, and its application goes beyond the simple adoption of a BDD framework.

73	Behave	A Multi-Case Study of Agile Requirements Engineering and the Use of Test Cases as Requirements	ContextIt is an enigma that agile projects can succeed 'without requirements' when weak requirements engineering is a known cause for project failures. While agile development projects often manage well without extensive requirements test cases are commonly viewed as requirements and detailed requirements are documented as test cases. ObjectiveWe have investigated this agile practice of using test cases as requirements to understand how test cases can support the main requirements activities, and how this practice varies. MethodWe performed an iterative case study at three companies and collected data through 14 interviews and two focus groups. ResultsThe use of test cases as requirements poses both benefits and challenges when eliciting, validating, verifying, and managing requirements, and when used as a documented agreement. We have identified five variants of the test-cases-as-requirements practice, namely de facto, behaviour-driven, story-test driven, stand-alone strict and stand-alone manual for which the application of the practice varies concerning the time frame of requirements documentation, the requirements format, the extent to which the test cases are a machine executable specification and the use of tools which provide specific support for the practice of using test cases as requirements. ConclusionsThe findings provide empirical insight into how agile development projects manage and communicate requirements. The identified variants of the practice of using test cases as requirements can be used to perform in-depth investigations into agile requirements engineering. Practitioners can use the provided recommendations as a guide in designing and improving their agile requirements practices based on project characteristics such as number of stakeholders and rate of change.

74	Behave	Continuous Delivery: Overcoming adoption challenges	Continuous Delivery (CD) is a relatively new software development approach. Companies that have adopted CD have reported significant benefits. Motivated by these benefits, many companies would like to adopt CD. However, adopting CD can be very challenging for a number of reasons, such as obtaining buy-in from a wide range of stakeholders whose goals may seemingly be different from—or even conflict with—our own; gaining sustained support in a dynamic complex enterprise environment; maintaining an application development team's momentum when their application's migration to CD requires an additional strenuous effort over a long period of time; and so on. To help overcome the adoption challenges, I present six strategies: (1) selling CD as a painkiller; (2) establishing a dedicated team with multi-disciplinary members; (3) continuous delivery of continuous delivery; (4) starting with the easy but important applications; (5) visual CD pipeline skeleton; (6) expert drop. These strategies were derived from four years of experience in implementing CD at a multi-billion-euro company. Additionally, our experience led to the identification of eight further challenges for research. The information contributes toward building a body of knowledge for CD adoption.

78	Behave	SS-BDD:Automated Acceptance Testing for Spreadsheets	Current Spreadsheet Applications, such as Excel and Google Sheets, provide innumerous built-in facilities, including arithmetic, financial and statistical operations, as well as conditional expressions. Thus, users with little or no formal training in programming can use Spreadsheet Applications to implement their own Spreadsheet Programs. In fact, Spreadsheet Applications have become one of the most popular end-user programming environments nowadays. However, these applications also ease the introduction of errors in Spreadsheet Programs. Minor mistakes in formulas can mislead decisionmaking processes, resulting in uncountable costs to organizations. In general, end-user programmers are unaware of the potential risks that the uncontrolled construction of Spreadsheet Programs can cause. Therefore, a major focus of this paper is to offer an automated approach that makes programmers aware of introduced faults, so that they can build high quality Spreadsheet Programs. In particular, we propose SS-BDD, a framework for building and running Spreadsheets test scenarios, which relies on the use of Behavior Driven Development (BDD). We used SS-BDD to test three different Spreadsheet Programs. Our experience shows that SS-BDD can be used to build end-user friendly test scenarios which can achieve high fault-detection effectiveness.

79	Behave	BMT: Behavior Driven Development-based Metamorphic Testing for Autonomous Driving Models	Deep Neural Network based models are widely used for perception and control in autonomous driving. Recent work leverages metamorphic testing to improve defect detection but is limited to using only an equality-based metamorphic relation. Thus, it does not provide sufficient expressiveness for users to define custom metamorphic relations nor means to automatically generate meaningful inputs based on such expressive metamorphic relations that reflect real-world traffic behaviors. In this paper, we preliminarily design and evaluate a declarative Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)-based metamorphic testing framework BMT, which enables domain experts to specify custom traffic behaviors-a car shall decelerate by x% when a bicycle is in front, etc. It then automatically translates a human-written behavior to a corresponding metamorphic relation and synthesizes meaningful test inputs using a variety of image and graphics processing techniques. Our preliminary evaluation shows that BMT can detect a significant number of erroneous predictions of three driving models for speed predictions. These detected erroneous predictions are manually examined and confirmed by six human judges as meaningful traffic violations. By automating test generation from custom behaviors, BMT enables experts to easily express domain-specific constraints and finds violations of such constraints.

80	Behave	3DEvent: A Framework Using Event-Sourcing Approach for 3D Web-Based Collaborative Design in P2P	Despite recent advances, especially in web-based Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) using real-time 3D content, Web technology still requires an efficient way to distribute and stream large-scale 3D data. In this paper, we present 3DEvent: an event-driven framework to collaboratively manipulate predesigned 3D content in real-time on a web-based platform. This work introduces a new approach in achieving 3D object manipulation tasks during collaborative design stages using event-sourcing. Usually, a client-server architecture supports updates to the 3D environment state. Peer-to-peer (P2P) allows direct communication between teammates reducing response times during collaboration and decreasing server load, reducing the costs of providers. 3DEvent enables P2P-assisted delivery of 3D dynamic content in a web browser via WebRTC. By combining concepts from distributed event-processing and mesh-processing, 3D independent rendering and event-based synchronization, we present 3DEvent framework and potential uses associated that support history-aware 3D applications into a unified distributed processing solution for 3D web-based CVEs.	collaborative manipulation; distributed application; event-driven architecture; Web 3D; WebRTC	Desprat, Caroline; Jessel, Jean-Pierre; Luga, Hervé	Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Web3D Technology					Excluded	Excluded	new_screen			2						
81	Behave	Test-Driven Development of Relational Databases	Developers can use a test-driven development with database schema just as they use it with application code. Implementing test-driven database development (TDDD) involves three relatively simple steps: database refactoring, database regression testing, and continuous database integration. In database refactoring, developers make a simple change to a database to improve the design without changing its semantics. In database regression testing, they run a comprehensive test suite that validates the database regularly-ideally, whenever developers change the database schema or access the database in a different way. In continuous database integration, developers rebuild and retest the database schema whenever it changes. From a technical viewpoint, TDDD is straightforward. However, cultural challenges can make it difficult to adopt.

82	Behave	Automatic production of end user documentation for DSLs	Domain-specific languages (DSL) are developed for answering specific problems by leveraging the expertise of domain stakeholders. The development of DSLs requires a significant software engineering effort: editors, code generators, etc, must be developed to make a DSL usable. Documenting a DSL is also a major and time-consuming task required to promote it and address its learning curve. Recent research work in software language engineering focus on easing the development of DSLs. This work focuses on easing the production of documentation of textual DSLs. The API documentation domain identified challenges we adapted to DSL documentation. Based on these challenges we propose a model-driven approach that relies on DSL artifacts to extract information required to build documentation. Our implementation, called Docywood, targets two platforms: Markdown documentation for static web sites and Xtext code fragments for live documentation while modeling. We used Docywood on two DSLs, namely ThingML and Target Platform Definition. Feedback from end users and language designers exhibits qualitative benefits of the proposal with regard to the DSL documentation challenges. End user experiments conducted on ThingML and Target Platform Definition show benefits on the correctness of the created models when using Docywood on ThingML.

In this paper we develop a process for evidence-based language engineering to design domain-specific languages based on empirical evidence to support decision in language engineering. The developed process comprises an iterative execution of the phases DSL engineering, issue identification, data collection and evidence appraisal. We exemplify the concept by designing a DSL for Gherkin, a language test-driven acceptance testing in Xtext. The required evidence is derived by mining and analyzing all GitHub projects until July 1, 2017 that apply Gherkin.

84	Behave	Reproducing Failures Based on Semiformal Failure Scenario Descriptions	Due to the increasing size and complexity of software systems, it becomes hard to test these systems exhaustively. As a result, some faults can be left undetected. Undetected faults can lead to failures in deployed systems. Such failures are usually reported by the users from the field or test engineers back to developers. It requires considerable time and effort to analyze and reproduce the reported failures because their descriptions are not always complete, structured and formal. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for automatically reproducing failures to aid their debugging. Our approach relies on semi-structured failure scenario descriptions that employ a set of keywords. These descriptions are preprocessed and mapped to a set of predefined test case templates with valid input sets. Then, test cases are generated and executed to reproduce the reported failure scenarios. The approach is evaluated with an industrial case study performed in a company from the telecommunications domain. Several failures were successfully reproduced. The approach is also adopted in the quality assurance process of the company. After one-time preparation of reusable test case templates and training of test engineers, 24.9 % of the reported failures (and 40 % of those that were manually reproducible) could be reproduced without any manual effort.

85	Behave	Behaviour-driven requirements engineering for agile product line engineering	Due to the need of the software development community to integrate the flexibility and the high responsiveness of agile software development with the economic advantages, of reuse and mass customisation, offered by product lines, agile product line engineering has been gaining a momentum of attention from both researchers and practitioners. Developing and managing the different requirements engineering phases of product lines present is a dilemma that the efforts done in the literature was not able to effectively and efficiently resolve. To realise the full potential of agile product line engineering in practice, a complete, consistent, correct, and unambiguous user requirements must be produced without investing that huge amount of time in the upfront domain engineering phase of a traditional software product line. In this proposal, a behaviour-driven cloud-based framework is introduced to develop and maintain software product lines in an agile-based environment. The approach relies on upfront automated testing to derive and manage core assets and variations of an agile-based software product line. The model is validated through an empirical study and the preliminary results are very promising. © 2019 IEEE.		Elshandidy H.

86	Behave	From Requirements to Source Code: A Model-Driven Engineering Approach for RESTful Web Services	During the last few years, the REST architectural style has drastically changed the way web services are developed. Due to its transparent resource-oriented model, the RESTful paradigm has been incorporated into several development frameworks that allow rapid development and aspire to automate parts of the development process. However, most of the frameworks lack automation of essential web service functionality, such as authentication or database searching, while the end product is usually not fully compliant to REST. Furthermore, most frameworks rely heavily on domain specific modeling and require developers to be familiar with the employed modeling technologies. In this paper, we present a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) engine that supports fast design and implementation of web services with advanced functionality. Our engine provides a front-end interface that allows developers to design their envisioned system through software requirements in multimodal formats. Input in the form of textual requirements and graphical storyboards is analyzed using natural language processing techniques and semantics, to semi-automatically construct the input model for the MDE engine. The engine subsequently applies model-to-model transformations to produce a RESTful, ready-to-deploy web service. The procedure is traceable, ensuring that changes in software requirements propagate to the underlying software artefacts and models. Upon assessing our methodology through a case study and measuring the effort reduction of using our tools, we conclude that our system can be effective for the fast design and implementation of web services, while it allows easy wrapping of services that have been engineered with traditional methods to the MDE realm.

Software requirements can be specified in different formats, for instance using free texts or more structured forms, such as use cases and user stories used in Behavior Driven Development (BDD). We present a comparative analysis on the requirements communication dynamics using use case specification and user stories as the basis for mockups creation. We carried out an exploratory empirical study involving 16 students. The study comprised 3 steps: requirements specification, mockups construction, and inspection to investigate whether the mockups were in accordance with the specifications. Results show that there is no significant difference in using use case specification or user stories to communicate software requirements. Our findings suggest that different specification formats can provide similar results while communicating requirements, nonetheless the human factor should not be neglected.

In order to support the creation of these models and generate artifacts useful for software designs, we have developed the Problem-to-Design tool (PROD) based on Jackson's Problem Frames approach. The tool has been inspired by the work in the behavior-driven development community, which recommends that testing codes be generated as early as in the requirements engineering phase. The tool provides an open portal where multiple stakeholders can draw their own problem diagrams online, which can be used to generate use case narratives and testing codes for further behavior-driven development.

89	Behave	Behavior-driven Development for Real-time Embedded Systems	Embedded systems are a class of computer systems that are typically characterized by a tight interaction with the physical environment. Various methodologies have been adopted for the development of such systems, ranging from traditional waterfall to modern agile techniques. One of the agile techniques that has recently attracted increasing attention is Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). BDD promotes the engagement of all stakeholders in every development iteration to minimize the misunderstanding between technical and non-technical stakeholders and, consequently, to speed up the development process and lower the costs. In this paper, we investigate the application of BDD to the development of embedded systems, especially focusing on the testing of timing requirements for real-time embedded software. In particular, we extend BDD with time-related concepts and propose an approach to generate test code for the verification of timing behavior of real-time embedded systems. Our approach offers more automation for the development of test code compared to existing BDD tools, thus minimizing the risk of timing faults and reducing development costs and time-to-market.		A.

This paper presents an approach based on Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) which employs an ontology in order to provide automated assessment for web GUIs. The approach has been evaluated by exploiting user requirements described by a group of experts in the flight tickets e-commerce domain. Such requirements gave rise to a set of User Stories that have been used to automatically assess the GUIs of an existing web system for booking business trips. The results have shown our approach was able to identify different types of inconsistencies in the set of GUIs analyzed, allowing to build an effective correspondence between user requirements and their representation on the GUI. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

94	Behave	A Practical Method for API Testing in the Context of Continuous Delivery and Behavior Driven Development	Enterprises are increasingly adopting an API-first approach to connect and expose software services. Saxo Bank is no exception to this. Crafting test suites for such APIs can seem straight forward due to the headless nature, but our experience shows that test suites often have two problems. The first problem is that execution of tests tends to fail and pass in seemingly nondeterministic ways (tests are flaky). The second problem is that functional coverage is not clearly documented. We have found that both problems stem from a lack of explicit focus on initial context (IC), a concept from behavior driven development. When a test is flaky it is often because actual IC in the test environment is not as required by the test. When functional coverage is not clear, it is most often because a systematic analysis involving IC was not performed. We propose a method for test analysis in which we include IC in the input space when analyzing functional coverage for an API, thereby including anything which can influence the outcome of test cases. Establishing IC is in general a hard problem. We have found that focus on the bounded context, a concept from domain driven design, of the system under test is a practical way to establish relevant IC. Experience with Saxo Bank's Open API shows that this method allows testers and developers to cooperate continuously, producing test plan documents which include the reasoning behind functional coverage. Explicit focus on IC in automated test case implementations turns flaky tests into tests which report on required IC in a test environment. The method easily generalizes to all levels of API tests.

Such requirements gave rise to a set of BDD stories that have been used to automatically assess scenarios extracted from task models that were reengineered from an existing web system for booking business trips. The results have shown our approach, by performing a static analysis of the source files, was able to identify different types of inconsistencies between the user requirements and the set of task models analyzed. © 2020 ACM.

97	Behave	A Study of Value in Agile Software Development Organizations	Examines how Value is interpreted in 14 agile software development organizations.Data is collected from 13 project managers and 10 product owners.Sixteen categories of Value Aspects are identified and prioritized.The most important Value Aspect is Delivery process w.r.t. time.The most used activity to achieve Value is activities related to agile practices. The Agile manifesto focuses on the delivery of valuable software. In Lean, the principles emphasise value, where every activity that does not add value is seen as waste. Despite the strong focus on value, and that the primary critical success factor for software intensive product development lies in the value domain, no empirical study has investigated specifically what value is. This paper presents an empirical study that investigates how value is interpreted and prioritised, and how value is assured and measured. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with 23 participants from 14 agile software development organisations. The contribution of this study is fourfold. First, it examines how value is perceived amongst agile software development organisations. Second, it compares the perceptions and priorities of the perceived values by domains and roles. Third, it includes an examination of what practices are used to achieve value in industry, and what hinders the achievement of value. Fourth, it characterises what measurements are used to assure, and evaluate value-creation activities.

98	Behave	Domain-specific scenarios for refinement-based methods	Formal methods use abstraction and rigorously verified refinement to manage the design of complex systems, ensuring that they satisfy important invariant properties. However, formal verification is not sufficient: models must also be tested to ensure that they behave according to the informal requirements and validated by domain experts who may not be expert in formal modelling. This can be satisfied by scenarios that complement the requirements specification. The model can be animated to check whether the scenario is feasible in the model and that the model reaches the states expected in the scenario. However, there are two problems with this approach. 1) The natural language used to describe the scenarios is often verbose, ambiguous and therefore difficult to understand; especially if the modeller is not a domain expert. 2) Provided scenarios are typically at the most concrete level corresponding to the full requirements and cannot be used until all the refinements have been completed in the model. We show by example how a precise and concise domain specific language can be used for writing these abstract scenarios in a style that can be easily understood by the domain expert (for validation purposes) as well as the modeller (for behavioural verification) and can be used as the persistence for automated tool support. We propose two alternative approaches to using scenarios during formal modelling: A method of refining scenarios before the model is refined so that the scenarios guide the modelling, and a method of abstracting scenarios from provided concrete ones so that they can be used to test early refinements of the model. We illustrate the two approaches on the ‘Tokeneer’ secure enclave example and the ERTMS/ETCS Hybrid Level 3 specification for railway controls. We base our approach on the Cucumber framework for scenarios and the Event-B modelling language and tool set. We have developed a new ‘Scenario Checker’ plugin to manage the animation of scenarios.11The example model and scenario scripts supporting this paper are openly available at https://doi.org/10.5258/SOTON/D1026.

99	Behave	Behaviour-Driven Formal Model Development of the ETCS Hybrid Level 3	Formal systems modelling offers a rigorous system-level analysis resulting in a precise and reliable specification. However, some issues remain: Modellers need to understand the requirements in order to formulate the models, formal verification may focus on safety properties rather than temporal behaviour, domain experts need to validate the final models to ensure they fit the needs of stakeholders. In this paper we discuss how the principles of Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) can be applied to formal systems modelling and validation. We propose a process where manually authored scenarios are used initially to support the requirements and help the modeller. The same scenarios are used to verify behavioural properties of the model. The model is then mutated to automatically generate scenarios that have a more complete coverage than the manual ones. These automatically generated scenarios are used to animate the model in a final acceptance stage. For this acceptance stage, it is important that a domain expert decides whether or not the behaviour is useful. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

103	Behave	A real-life application of multi-agent systems for fault diagnosis in the provision of an Internet business service	Given that telecommunications networks are constantly growing in complexity and heterogeneity, management systems have to work with incomplete data, handle uncertain situations and deal with dynamic environments. In addition, the high competitiveness in the telecommunications market requires cost cutting and customer retention by providing reliable systems. Thus, improving fault diagnosis systems and reducing the mean time to repair with automatic systems is an important area of research for telecommunications companies. This paper presents a Fault Diagnosis Multi-Agent System (MAS) applied for the management of a business service of Telefónica Czech Republic. The proposed MAS is based on an extended Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model that combines heterogeneous reasoning processes, ontology-based reasoning and Bayesian reasoning. This hybrid diagnostic technique is described in detail in the paper. The system has been evaluated with data collected during one and a half years of system operation on a live network. The main benefits of the system have been a significant reduction in both the average incident solution time and the mean diagnosis time.

104	Behave	Behavior-driven development (BDD) Cucumber Katalon for Automation GUI testing case CURA and Swag Labs	Graphical user interface (GUI) is widely used in software applications. About 50% of the application code is for GUI implementation. Because labor costs are high and demands for high-quality software are increasing, automation GUI testing will be a good investment for any software company. We will apply the Behavior-driven development (BDD) method for automation GUI testing with the Cucumber framework on the CURA and Swag Labs web applications. The BDD methodology used is based on the NLP (natural language program) concept. Where the information of semi-automatically produce a step definition and code framework. The scenarios are given on the natural language and then applied to Software Testing. Class diagrams and sequence diagrams are also applied to each represent a code framework automatically. The author uses Katalon Studio software. It was found that the results of the test case automation GUI testing on the CURA website with 210 steps passed, 3 step warnings with average responses times in the test case were 1.92 minutes. The results of the test case automation GUI testing on the Swag Labs web with 87 where 36 steps failed, 4 step warning and 44 step passed with an average responses times in the test case are 2,122 minutes.

105	Behave	Behaviour driven development for hardware design	Hardware verification requires a lot of effort. A recent study showed that on average, there are more verification engineers working on a project than design engineers. Hence, one of the biggest challenges in design and verification today is to find new ways to increase the productivity. For software development the agile methodology as an incremental approach has been proposed and is heavily used. Behavior Driven Development (BDD) as an agile technique additionally enables a direct link to natural language based testing. In this article, we show how BDD can be extended to make it viable for hardware design. In addition, we present a two-fold strategy which allows to specify textual acceptance tests and textual formal properties. Finally, this strategy is complemented by methods to generalize tests to properties, and to enhance design understanding by presenting debug and witness scenarios in natural language. © 2018 Information Processing Society of Japan.

106	Behave	Using acceptance tests to predict files changed by programming tasks	In a collaborative development context, conflicting code changes might compromise software quality and developers productivity. To reduce conflicts, one could avoid the parallel execution of potentially conflicting tasks. Although hopeful, this strategy is challenging because it relies on the prediction of the required file changes to complete a task. As predicting such file changes is hard, we investigate its feasibility for BDD (Behaviour-Driven Development) projects, which write automated acceptance tests before implementing features. We develop a tool that, for a given task, statically analyzes Cucumber tests and infers test-based interfaces (files that could be executed by the tests), approximating files that would be changed by the task. To assess the accuracy of this approximation, we measure precision and recall of test-based interfaces of 513 tasks from 18 Rails projects on GitHub. We also compare such interfaces with randomly defined interfaces, interfaces obtained by textual similarity of test specifications with past tasks, and interfaces computed by executing tests. Our results give evidence that, in the specific context of BDD, Cucumber tests might help to predict files changed by tasks. We find that the better the test coverage, the better the predictive power. A hybrid approach for computing test-based interfaces is promising.

107	Behave	Ensuring the Consistency Between User Requirements and GUI Prototypes: A Behavior-Based Automated Approach	In a user-centered design process, graphical user interface (GUI) prototypes may be seen as an important early artifact to design and validate user requirements before making strong commitments with a full-fledged version of the user interface. Ensuring the consistency of GUI prototypes with other representations of the user requirements is then a critical aspect of the design process. This paper presents an approach which extends Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) by employing an ontology in order to provide automated assessment for GUI prototypes as design artifacts. The approach has been evaluated by exploiting user requirements described by a group of experts in the flight tickets e-commerce domain. Such requirements gave rise to a set of User Stories that have been used to automatically check the consistency of Balsamiq prototypes which were reengineered from an existing web system for booking business trips. The results have shown our approach was able to identify different types of inconsistencies in the set of analyzed artifacts, allowing to build an effective correspondence between user requirements and their representation in GUI prototypes. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2019.

108	Behave	Definition of a Behavior-Driven Model for Requirements Specification and Testing of Interactive Systems	In a user-centered development process, artifacts are aimed to evolve in iterative cycles until they meet users' requirements and then become the final product. Every cycle gives the opportunity to revise the design and to introduce new requirements which might affect the specification of artifacts that have been set in former development phases. Testing the consistency of multiple artifacts used to develop interactive systems every time that a new requirement is introduced it is a cumbersome and time consuming activity, especially if it should be done manually. For that we propose an approach based on Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to support the automated assessment of artifacts along the development process of interactive systems. In order to prevent that test should be written to every type of artifact, we investigate the use of ontologies for specifying the test once and then run it in all artifacts sharing the ontological concepts.

110	Behave	A Domain Specific Test Language for Systems Integration	In avionic context, systems are complex, embedded, critical, reactive and real time. In this context, testing activities are predominant in a V development process. We propose to bring in some features coming from agile methods. System integration testing that means systems are tested individually and together in order to ensure that they all operate correctly. We focus on functional and system integration testing just before the ground testing phase. Nowadays, test procedures and test plans we studied are described in textual manner and are executed manually. We aim to provide a common specific language that improves communications for the team of test designers and between test designers and test performers. In the same manner as agile test frameworks, this language allows to structure the test procedures. Moreover, this language tends to facilitate the automatic execution of some parts of the procedures. We choose a domain specific language approach to design a first domain specific test language dedicated to networks system integration.

111	Behave	Assisted Behavior Driven Development Using Natural Language Processing	In Behavior Driven Development (BDD), acceptance tests provide the starting point for the software design flow and serve as a basis for the communication between designers and stakeholders. In this agile software development technique, acceptance tests are written in natural language in order to ensure a common understanding between all members of the project. As a consequence, mapping the sentences to actual source code is the first step of the design flow, which is usually done manually.However, the scenarios described by the acceptance tests provide enough information in order to automatize the extraction of both the structure of the implementation and the test cases. In this work, we propose an assisted flow for BDD where the user enters into a dialog with the computer which suggests code pieces extracted from the sentences. For this purpose, natural language processing techniques are exploited. This allows for a semi-automatic transformation from acceptance tests to source code stubs and thus provides a first step towards an automatization of BDD.

112	Behave	Maintaining behaviour driven development specifications: Challenges and opportunities	"In Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) the behaviour of a software system is specified as a set of example interactions with the system using a ""Given-When-Then"" structure. These examples are expressed in high level domain-specific terms, and are executable. They thus act both as a specification of requirements and as tests that can verify whether the current system implementation provides the desired behaviour or not. This approach has many advantages but also presents some problems. When the number of examples grows, BDD specifications can become costly to maintain and extend. Some teams find that parts of the system are effectively frozen due to the challenges of finding and modifying the examples associated with them. We surveyed 75 BDD practitioners from 26 countries to understand the extent of BDD use, its benefits and challenges, and specifically the challenges of maintaining BDD specifications in practice. We found that BDD is in active use amongst respondents, and that the use of domain specific terms, improving communication among stakeholders, the executable nature of BDD specifications, and facilitating comprehension of code intentions are the main benefits of BDD. The results also showed that BDD specifications suffer the same maintenance challenges found in automated test suites more generally. We map the survey results to the literature, and propose 10 research opportunities in this area."	behaviour-driven development;test suite maintenance;test suite evolution	L. P. Binamungu; S. M.

113	Behave	Detecting duplicate examples in behaviour driven development specifications	In Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD), the behaviour of the software to be built is specified as a set of example interactions with the system, expressed using a “Given-When-Then” structure. The examples are written using customer language, and are readable by end-users. They are also executable, and act as tests that determine whether the implementation matches the desired behaviour or not. This approach can be effective in building a common understanding of the requirements, but it can also face problems. When the suites of examples grow large, they can be difficult and expensive to change. Duplication can creep in, and can be challenging to detect manually. Current tools for detecting duplication in code are also not effective for BDD examples. Moreover, human concerns of readability and clarity can rise. We present an approach for detecting duplication in BDD suites that is based around dynamic tracing, and describe an evaluation based on three open source systems.	behaviour-driven development;duplication detection;dynamic tracing	L.

114	Behave	Integrating Behavior Driven Development and Programming by Contract to Improve Correctness in Computer Programs	"In many professional development settings, Test Driven Development (TDD), and its evolutionary descendent, Behavior Driven Development (BDD) are increasingly being used to improve code quality and reducing error rates. While very valuable, they are considerably less rigorous than formal methodologies of program correctness via formal logic. A less rigorous methodology utilizing the ideas of formal methods but without requiring an actual full proof are also in use called ""Design by Contract"" (DBC) or ""Programming by Contract."" (PBC) This thesis will examine extending and combining the ideas behind TDD, BDD and DBC to improve the overall stability and quality of a system. It will examine using both TDD/BDD (hereinafter referred to as TDD) and PBC to enhance the quality of development throughout the software development life cycle, while aiding in the development and stabilization of sound architecture. A result of this examination is a tool that attempts to derive unit tests automatically by analyzing human written specifications for preconditions and post-conditions when coupled with data definitions. These results will be used to generate code to be run by a unit testing framework before deployment, either as part of a continuous integration environment or by individual developers. The tool will also attempt to generate wireframe classes implementing pre and post-conditions within the code and using runtime contract analysis to generate information when an exception occurs, thereby helping to automate verification of bug fixes. Ultimately, the tool produced would be useful in a non-academic environment as a utility to extend the benefit of design by contract combined with TDD to the agile space."

115	Behave	Leveraging natural-language requirements for deriving better acceptance criteria from models	In many software and systems development projects, analysts specify requirements using a combination of modeling and natural language (NL). In such situations, systematic acceptance testing poses a challenge because defining the acceptance criteria (AC) to be met by the system under test has to account not only for the information in the (requirements) model but also that in the NL requirements. In other words, neither models nor NL requirements per se provide a complete picture of the information content relevant to AC. Our work in this paper is prompted by the observation that a reconciliation of the information content in NL requirements and models is necessary for obtaining precise AC. We perform such reconciliation by devising an approach that automatically extracts AC-related information from NL requirements and helps modelers enrich their model with the extracted information. An existing AC derivation technique is then applied to the model that has now been enriched by the information extracted from NL requirements.

116	Behave	Toward A Service Platform for Developing Smart Contracts on Blockchain in BDD and TDD Styles	In recent years, Blockchain technology has been highly valued, and the related applications have begun to be developed in large numbers. A smart contract is a software component encompass business logics and transactions that run on a blockchain. Thus, verifying whether the contract logics fully reflect the business requirements are one of the most important software engineering issues in blockchain application development. Currently, developing smart contracts is still a challenging task even for experienced programmers due to the lacking of an integrated tool for developing and testing. In response to this challenge, this paper presents a service platform that supports BDD-style (Behavior-Driven Development) smart contract development, testing, and deployment for the Ethereum-based blockchains. This platform focuses on providing and resolving the cross-cutting concerns across the life-cycle of smart contract development. The feasibility of this platform is shown by demonstrating how an application scenario, namely, loyalty points exchange, can be implemented using the proposed platform. Our experiences indicate that the burdens of developers when developing smart contracts can be effectively reduced and thus increases the quality of contracts.

117	Behave	Proposing regulatory-driven automated test suites for electronic health record systems	In regulated domains such as finance and health care, failure to comply with regulation can lead to financial, civil and criminal penalties. While systems vary from organization to organization, regulations apply across organizations. We propose the use of Behavior-Driven-Development (BDD) scenarios as the basis of an automated compliance test suite for standards such as regulation and interoperability. Such test suites could become a shared asset for use by all systems subject to these regulations and standards. Each system, then, need only create their own system-specific test driver code to automate their compliance checks. The goal of this research is to enable organizations to compare their systems to regulation in a repeatable and traceable way through the use of BDD. To evaluate our proposal, we developed an abbreviated HIPAA test suite and applied it to three open-source electronic health record systems. The scenarios covered all security behavior defined by the selected regulation. The system-specific test driver code covered all security behavior defined in the scenarios, and identified where the tested system lacked such behavior.	behavior-driven-development; healthcare it; regulatory compliance; security; software engineering; software testing	Patrick Morrison; Casper Holmgreen; Aaron Massey; Laurie Williams	SEHC '13: Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Software Engineering in Health Care	https://doi.org/10.5555/2663575.2663588		46-49		Included	Included	new_screen			2	ACM		Proposing Regulatory-Driven Automated Test Suites for Electronic Health Record Systems		IEEE Press	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

119	Behave	Combining IID with BDD to Enhance the Critical Quality of Security Functional Requirements	In software system, functional requirements are primary system requirements. Client cannot explicitly depicted security requirements and the development team is hard to understand security requirements, makes security requirements difficult to specific implant software system. In software system development process, security requirements often neglected and ignored. However, the cost of correcting security flaws in maintenance phase is over 100 times in requirements phase. Can't effectively improve the system security, enterprises loss is bound to continue to expand. In order to enhance the security of software system, this paper combines the popular software development methodology IID (Interactive and Incremental Development) with BDD (Behavior Driven Development), institutionalized requires functional requirements must be integrated into security requirements. And, using BDD process features to evaluate the major quality of security functional requirements.

120	Behave	Test-Driven Development of Relational Databases	In test-first development, developers formulate and implement a detailed design iteratively, one test at a time. Test-driven development (also called test-driven design) combines TFD with refactoring, wherein developers make small changes (refactorings) to improve code design without changing the code's semantics. When developers decide to use TDD to implement a new feature, they must first ask whether the current design is the easiest possible design to enable the feature's addition. Implementing test-driven database design involves database refactoring, regression testing, and continuous integration. TDDD is an integrated part of the overall development process, not a standalone activity that data professionals perform in parallel with application TDD. Although from a technical view point, TDDD is relatively straightforward, we must overcome several challenges to its whole sale adoption throughout the IT community	test-driven development;TDD;database refactoring;database testing;test-driven database design;TDD;relational database;behavior-driven development;BDD	S.

121	Behave	Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: Mobile Application Development: Automated Test Input Generation Via Model Inference based on User Story and Acceptance Criteria	In the past few years, there has been observed explosive growth in the development of Mobile Applications across Android and iOS operating system which has led to the direct impact towards mobile app development. In order to design and propose quality-oriented apps, it is the primary responsibility of the developers to devote time and sufficient efforts towards testing to make the Apps bug free and operational in the hands of end users without any hiccup. In order to test the mobile apps, manual testing procedures takes prolonged amount of time in writing test cases and even the full testing requirements are not met. In addition to this, lack of sufficient knowledge by the tester also impacts overall quality and assurance that app is bug free. To overcome all the issues of testing, and to assure that apps designed by developers are almost bug free, we propose a new testing methodology cum tool 'AgileUATM' which works primarily towards white-box and black-box testing. With this tool, all the test cases are generated automatically based on user stories and acceptance criteria by using formal specification and Z3 SMT solvers. To test the validity of the proposed tool, we applied the tool in real-time operational environment with regard to test Mobile apps. Using this tool, all the acceptance criteria is determined via user stories. The testers/developers specify requirements with formal specifications based on programs properties, predicates, invariants, and constraints. From the results, it is observed that the proposed tool i.e. AgileUATM generated effective and accurate test cases, test input, and expected output was generated in a unified fashion from the user stories to meet acceptance criteria. In addition to this, the tool also reduced the development time to identify test data as compared to manual Behavior Driven Development (BDD) methodologies. With this tool, the developers got better idea with regard to required tests and able to translate the customers natural languages to the computer language as well. © 2019 IEEE.

123	Behave	Combination of Test-Driven Development and Behavior-Driven Development for Improving Backend Testing Performance	In the process of software development, a testing phase is an important step for detecting the errors. In order to produce a reliable application, this paper discusses the utilization of a combination from two different testing methods, Test- Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD). TDD testing method is a process with a high percentage of code which is tested automatically. However, it could lead to an error when the parameters of the features are changed. Meanwhile, the BDD testing method is a testing method that could perform successfully despite changes to the parameters of the features. This paper discusses the combination of TDD and BDD testing methods, which is called as T-BDD method. By implementing T-BDD into the Vixio backend system, this paper successfully shows that it could be performed to achieve a high percentage of test-coverage while it could also adapt when the parameters of the features were changed. This paper also shows that the T-BDD testing method performed better compared to using the TDD testing method only.

124	Behave	Requirements behaviour analysis for ontology testing	In the software engineering field, every software product is delivered with its pertinent associated tests which verify its correct behaviour. Besides, there are several approaches which, integrated in the software development process, deal with software testing, such as unit testing or behaviour-driven development. However, in the ontology engineering field there is a lack of clearly defined testing processes that can be integrated into the ontology development process. In this paper we propose a testing framework composed by a set of activities (i.e., test design, implementation and execution), with the goal of checking whether the requirements identified are satisfied by the formalization and analysis of their expected behaviour. This testing framework can be used in different types of ontology development life-cycles, or concerning other goals such as conformance testing between ontologies. In addition to this, we propose an RDF vocabulary to store, publish and reuse these test cases and their results, in order to allow traceability between the ontology, the test cases and their requirements. We validate our approach by integrating the testing framework into an ontology engineering process where an ontology network has been developed following agile principles. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

125	Behave	Skyfire: Model-Based Testing with Cucumber	In the software industry, a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) tool, Cucumber, has been widely used by practitioners. Usually product analysts, developers, and testers manually write BDD test scenarios that describe system behaviors. Testers write implementation for the BDD scenarios by hand and execute the Cucumber tests. Cucumber provides transparency about what test scenarios are covered and how the test scenarios are mapped to executable tests. One drawback of the Cucumber BDD approach is that test scenarios are generated manually. Thus, the test scenarios are usually weak. More importantly, practitioners do not have a metric to measure test coverage. In this paper, we present a Model-Based Testing (MBT) tool, skyfire. Skyfire can automatically generate effective Cucumber test scenarios to replace manually generated test scenarios. Skyfire reads a behavioral UML diagram (e.g., a state machine diagram), identifies all necessary elements (e.g., transitions) of the diagram, generates effective tests to satisfy various graph coverage criteria, and converts the tests into Cucumber scenarios. Then testers write Cucumber mappings for the generated scenarios. Skyfire does not only generate effective tests but is also completely compatible with the existing agile development and continuous integration (CI) rhythm. We present the design architecture and implementation of skyfire, as well as an industrial case study to show how skyfire is used in practice.

126	Behave	Systematic verification and testing	In this chapter, we present a process pattern for model based specification, verification and testing. It combines concepts of behaviour driven development (BDD), graphical and formal, mathematical modelling, formal verification techniques, acceptance testing and model based testing. The rigorous approach helps to ensure that for highly dependable systems, dependability (e.g. safety) requirements are fulfilled and both the specified and the implemented behaviour are as desired. It helps bridging the gap between natural language or semi-formal requirements and mathematical abstraction. Furthermore, it addresses the issue that formal modelling expertise and domain knowledge are rarely held by the same set of people. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

127	Behave	BDD by example:Russian bylina written in Gherkin language	"In this paper is presented the User Stories technique within the Behaviour-Driven Development process by example of the famous Russian bylina (epic poem) ""Three trips of Ilya Muromets"" written in Gherkin language. In the first part are given explanations about the choice of the bylina as a good example for presentation of this technique and about the choice of GitHub as a good environment for this presentation. In the second part is placed the text of the presentation divided by the stages of the Story development and fitted with the links to the corresponding commits and file versions in the educational repository. A distinct advantage of this presentation is that it reflects a Story in its evolution, as a process. It reflects a more complex and changeable behaviour than in static trivial examples, which are usually used. Also, there are presented the main features of using the User Stories technique in Russian language, which have not been previously covered nowhere. Besides that, the using of the educational repository can significantly increase the possibilities for further spreading and development of the example."

128	Behave	Satisfaction and its correlates in agile software development	In this paper we address the topic of software development team members satisfaction with their development process. We present an in-depth analysis of the results of a nationwide survey about software development in Switzerland. We wanted to find out if satisfaction relates to the applied development method, and to the use of various practices, and impacts on business, team and software issues. We found that higher satisfaction is reported more by those using Agile development than with plan-driven processes. We explored the different perspectives of developers and those with a management role and found a high consistency of satisfaction between Agile developers and Agile management, and differences with those using working plan-driven methods. We found that certain practices and impacts have high correlations to satisfaction, and that collaborative processes are closely related to satisfaction. We then explored the relationship between satisfaction and various other perspectives. Our results in this analysis are principally descriptive, but we think they can be a relevant contribution to understand the challenges for everyone involved in Agile development.

129	Behave	Compliance checking on building models with the gherkin language and continuous integration	In this paper we document our approach on applying Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) and Continuous Integration (CI) from the software industry to the construction sector. We have provided a freely available open software toolset for the application of rules in the Gherkin syntax to an IFC building model. A prominent aspect of BDD and contrary to mvdXML, the formalization of rules in plain-test human-readable scenarios provides a basis for collaborative formalization of rules among stakeholders. At the same time our approach includes imperative program code that is fully extensible to incorporate for example external data sources and geometrical reasoning. Runnings test on every model revision (the CI concept) as opposed to, for example, upon model delivery ensures a proactive approach to compliance. Reusing existing open source frameworks allowed us to build a comprehensive solution for continuous and automated model checking, visualization and reporting in several hundred lines of program code. © EG-ICE 2020 Workshop on Intelligent Computing in Engineering, Proceedings.

130	Behave	Improving Agile Software Development with Domain Ontologies	In this paper we propose to apply domain ontologies in agile software development to reduce the ambiguity caused by using natural language as ubiquitous language to report user stories. To justify and demonstrate our approach, we present a case study that combines Scrum and Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) in the development of an educational support system, which was built to support the activities of the Medicine Programme of Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) in Brazil. Starting from a reference ontology for the Higher Education domain, we gradually specialized this ontology for this programme. Since we selected the Evaluation Management module of this system for our case study, we applied the Evaluation Process Ontology to that programme, and defined user stories to identify the feature set to be implemented. For evaluation and validation purposes, we assessed the quality of all ontologies used in this work according to structural and functional dimensions. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.		de Souza P.L., do Prado A.F., de Souza W.L., dos Santos Forghieri Pereira S.M., Pires L.F.

132	Behave	Consistency Reflection for Automatic Update of Testing Environment	In this paper, we present an approach for maintaining consistency among design models, system under test, and test components. Our approach provides an automatic updating technique to deal with changes that happen frequently in agile software development. Consistency reflection by automatic updating allows us to cut off manual tasks required in maintaining automated tests and speed up testing process which is a bottleneck in service development lifecycle. We introduce the use of metadata, the data structure that describes structural behavior of the system, in our automatic updating technique. Metadata is used as a common medium for communicating changes to keep consistency among design, system under test, and test components. We present an example of testing process to show how we apply this approach in practice.	behavior-driven development; agile software development; automated software testing; automatic update; consistency reflection; design models; metadata	Sathawornwichit, Chaiwat; Hosono, Shigeru	Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference)					Included	Included	new_screen			2

On the other hand, they can be checked against time-oriented data recorded during testing sessions of the implemented CIG.

135	Behave	A preliminary study on using acceptance tests for representing business requirements of smart contracts	"In this work, we address the following question: ""Which acceptance testing techniques are being used for representing business requirements of smart contracts?"" To answer this question we performed a systematic mapping to determine whether acceptance tests for smart contracts and blockchain are being utilized to represent requirements and which acceptance testing techniques are being applied. This systematic mapping shows that, in fact, acceptance testing techniques are still not commonly used to represent the business requirements of smart contracts. We only found two studies using acceptance testing techniques with smart contracts. Moreover, only one of them uses an acceptance testing technique, the BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) notation, to represent the business requirements. In order to confirm that it is possible to represent business requirements of smart contracts, we developed an example that uses the BDD notation to represent requirements of a smart contract deployed in the Hyperledger blockchain. Preliminary results show that it is possible to use acceptance tests to represent business requirements."	acceptance testing;acceptance test;smart contract;business requirement;blockchain	Patricia Vilain; John Mylopoulos; Hans-Arno Jacobsen	2020 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (ICBC)	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBC48266.2020.9169480	"1.C.

138	Behave	Towards a behavior-oriented specification and testing language for multimodal applications	Initiated by the ubiquity of mobile devices, human computer interaction has evolved beyond the classic PCs' mouse and keyboard setup. Smartphones and tablets introduced new interaction modalities to the mass market and created the need for specialized software engineering methods. While more and more powerful SDKs are released to develop interactive applications, specifying user interaction is still ambiguous and error-prone, causing software defects as well as misunderstandings and frustration among project team members and stakeholders. We present an approach addressing this problems by demonstrating how to incorporate multimodal interaction into user acceptance tests written in near-natural language using Gherkin and formal gesture descriptions.	multimodal user interfaces; software engineering; specification	Marc Hesenius; Tobias Griebe; Volker Gruhn	EICS '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGCHI symposium on Engineering interactive computing systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/2607023.2610278		117-122		Included	Included	new_screen			2	ACM		Towards a Behavior-Oriented Specification and Testing Language for Multimodal Applications		Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
139	Behave	Improving the prediction of files changed by programming tasks	Integration conflicts often damage software quality and developers' productivity in a collaborative development environment. For reducing merge conflicts, we could avoid asking developers to execute potentially conflicting tasks in parallel, as long as we can predict the files to be changed by each task. As manually predicting that is hard, the TAITI tool tries to do that in the context of BDD (Behaviour-Driven Development) projects, by statically analysing the automated acceptance tests that validate each task. TAITI computes the set of files that might be executed by the tests of a task (a so called test-based task interface), approximating the files that developers will change when performing the task. Although TAITI performs better than a random task interface, there is space for accuracy improvements. In this paper, we extend the interfaces computed by TAITI by including the dependences of the application files reached by the task tests. To understand the potential benefits of our extension, we evaluate precision and recall of 60 task interfaces from 8 Rails GitHub projects. The results bring evidence that the extended interface improves recall by slightly compromising precision.

141	Behave	An industrial case study on test cases as requirements	It is a conundrum that agile projects can succeed ‘without requirements’ when weak requirements engineering is a known cause for project failures. While Agile development projects often manage well without extensive requirements documentation, test cases are commonly used as requirements. We have investigated this agile practice at three companies in order to understand how test cases can fill the role of requirements. We performed a case study based on twelve interviews performed in a previous study. The findings include a range of benefits and challenges in using test cases for eliciting, validating, verifying, tracing and managing requirements. In addition, we identified three scenarios for applying the practice, namely as a mature practice, as a de facto practice and as part of an agile transition. The findings provide insights into how the role of requirements may be met in agile development including challenges to consider. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

The language is interpreted, dynamic, weakly typed, and has first-class functions. It also interacts extensively with other web languages such as CSS and HTML at runtime. All these characteristics make JavaScript code particularly error-prone and challenging to analyze and test. In this chapter, we explore recent advances made in analysis and testing techniques geared toward JavaScript-based web applications. In particular, we look at recent empirical studies, testing techniques, test oracle automation approaches, test adequacy assessment methods, fault localization and repair, and Integrated Development Environment support to help programmers write better JavaScript code.

143	Behave	Mastering Symfony	Key FeaturesCreate a robust and reliable Symfony development pipeline using Amazon's cloud platformCut development and maintenance costs by defining crystal clear features and possible scenarios for each feature before implementationFollow detailed examples provided in each chapter to create a task management applicationBook DescriptionIn this book, you will learn some lesser known aspects of development with Symfony, and you will see how to use Symfony as a framework to create reliable and effective applications. You might have developed some impressive PHP libraries in other projects, but what is the point when your library is tied to one particular project? With Symfony, you can turn your code into a service and reuse it in other projects.This book starts with Symfony concepts such as bundles, routing, twig, doctrine, and more, taking you through the request/response life cycle. You will then proceed to set up development, test, and deployment environments in AWS. Then you will create reliable projects using Behat and Mink, and design business logic, cover authentication, and authorization steps in a security checking process. You will be walked through concepts such as DependencyInjection, service containers, and services, and go through steps to create customized commands for Symfony's console. Finally, the book covers performance optimization and the use of Varnish and Memcached in our project, and you are treated with the creation of database agnostic bundles and best practices.What you will learnInstall and configure Symfony and required third-party bundles to develop a task management applicationSet up a continuous integration server to orchestrate automatic builds every time you add a new feature to your projectReduce maintenance costs dramatically using Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)Create a slick user interface using the Bootstrap frameworkDesign robust business logic using DoctrineBuild a comprehensive dashboard and secure your project using the Sonata projectImprove performance using Redis, Memcache, and VarnishCreate customized Symfony commands and add them to your consoleAbout the AuthorSohail Salehi is a full stack web developer who is constantly seeking creative solutions for complex problems.

We start with the key concepts of the unit and testability, followed by hands-on exploration of key features. From the beginning, we learn how to integrate tests into the overall development process to help create high-quality code, avoiding the dangers of testing for its own sake.We build up sample applications and their corresponding tests step by step, from simple beginnings to more sophisticated versions that include databases and external web services. We devote three chapters to web applications with rich JavaScript user interfaces, building one from the ground up using behavior-driven development (BDD) and test-driven development (TDD).The code examples are detailed enough to be realistic while simple enough to be easily understood. Testing concepts, development methodologies, and engineering tradeoffs are discussed in detail as they arise. This approach is designed to foster the reader's ability to make well-informed decisions on their own.What you will learnIdentify a unit of software for the purposes of testingManage test states with hooks, fixtures, and mocksHandle external web services in tests using various techniquesConfigure RSpec flexibly and cleanly using support code and environment variablesInteract with rich web apps in tests using CapybaraBuild the right feature with behavior-driven developmentCustomize matchers and failure messagesVerify correct development and production environmentsAbout the AuthorMani Tadayon first learned to program as a shy 7th grader on an Apple IIe using BASIC.

145	Behave	Crowdsourced Behavior-Driven Development	Key to the effectiveness of crowdsourcing approaches for software engineering is workflow design, describing how complex work is organized into small, relatively independent microtasks. This paper, we introduce a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) workflow for accomplishing programming work through self-contained microtasks, implemented as a preconfigured environment called CrowdMicroservices. In our approach, a client, acting on behalf of a software team, describes a microservice as a set of endpoints with paths, requests, and responses. A crowd then implements the endpoints, identifying individual endpoint behaviors that they test, implement, debug, create new functions, and interact with persistence APIs as needed. To evaluate our approach, we conducted a feasibility study in which a small crowd worked to implement a small ToDo microservice. The crowd created an implementation with only four defects, completing 350 microtasks and implementing 13 functions. We discuss the implications of these findings for incorporating crowdsourced programming contributions into traditional software projects.

146	Behave	Using Language Workbenches and Domain-Specific Languages for Safety-Critical Software Development	Language workbenches support the efficient creation, integration, and use of domain-specific languages. Typically, they execute models by code generation to programming language code. This can lead to increased productivity and higher quality. However, in safety-/mission-critical environments, generated code may not be considered trustworthy, because of the lack of trust in the generation mechanisms. This makes it harder to justify the use of language workbenches in such an environment. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach to use such tools in critical environments. We argue that models created with domain-specific languages are easier to validate and that the additional risk resulting from the transformation to code can be mitigated by a suitably designed transformation and verification architecture. We validate the approach with an industrial case study from the healthcare domain. We also discuss the degree to which the approach is appropriate for critical software in space, automotive, and robotics systems.

149	Behave	Challenges &amp; Opportunities in Low-Code Testing	Low-code is a growing development approach supported by many platforms. It fills the gap between business and IT by supporting the active involvement of non-technical domain experts, named Citizen Developer, in the application development lifecycle.Low-code introduces new concepts and characteristics. However, it is not investigated yet in academic research to point out the existing challenges and opportunities when testing low-code software. This shortage of resources motivates this research to provide an explicit definition to this area that we call it Low-Code Testing.In this paper, we initially conduct an analysis of the testing components of five commercial Low-Code Development Platforms (LCDP) to present low-code testing advancements from a business point of view. Based on the low-code principles as well as the result of our analysis, we propose a feature list for low-code testing along with possible values for them. This feature list can be used as a baseline for comparing low-code testing components and as a guideline for building new ones. Accordingly, we specify the status of the testing components of investigated LCDPs based on the proposed features. Finally, the challenges of low-code testing are introduced considering three concerns: the role of citizen developer in testing, the need for high-level test automation, and cloud testing. We provide references to the state-of-the-art to specify the difficulties and opportunities from an academic perspective. The results of this research can be used as a starting point for future research in low-code testing area.	testing; citizen developer; low-code; low-code development platform	Khorram, Faezeh; Mottu, Jean-Marie; Sunyé, Gerson	Proceedings of the 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings					Excluded	Excluded	new_screen			2						
150	Behave	Toward leveraging Gherkin Controlled Natural Language and Machine Translation for Global Product Information Development	Machine Translation (MT) already plays an important part in software development process at McAfee where the technology can be leveraged to provide early builds for localization and internationalization testing teams. Behavior Driven Development (BDD) has been growing in usage as a development methodology in McAfee. Within BDD, the Gherkin Controlled Natural Language (CNL) is a syntax and common terminology set that is used to describe the software or business process in a User Story. Given there exists this control on the language to describe User Stories for software features using Gherkin, we seek to use Machine Translation to Globalize it at high accuracy and without Post-Editing and reuse it as Product Information. This enables global product information development to happen as part of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and at low cost. © 2018 Morgan O’Brien, McAfee LLC.		O’Brien M.

151	Behave	Automating test oracles from restricted natural language agile requirements	Manual testing of software requirements written in natural language for agile or any other methodology requires more time and human resources. This leaves the testing process error prone and time consuming. For satisfied end users with bug-free software delivered on time, there is a need to automate the test oracle process for natural language or informal requirements. The automation of the test oracle is relatively easier with formal requirements, but this task is difficult to achieve with natural language requirements. This study proposes an approach called Restricted Natural Language Agile Requirements Testing (ReNaLART) to automate the test oracle from restricted natural language agile requirements. For this purpose, it uses an existing user story template with some modifications for writing user stories. This helps in identifying test input and expected output for a user story. For comparison of expected and observed outputs it makes use of a regex pattern and string distance functions. It is capable of assigning different types of verdicts automatically depending upon the similarity/dissimilarity between observed and expected outputs of user stories. ReNaLART is validated using several case studies of different domains, namely, OLX Pakistan, Mental Health Tests, McDelivery Pakistan, BlueStacks, Power Searching with Google, TensorFlow Playground, w3Schools 2018 offline and Touch'D. It revealed several faults in five of the above listed eight applications. Plus, the proposed test oracle on an average took 0.02 s for test data generation, expected output generation and verdict assignment. Both these facts show the fault revealing effectiveness and efficiency of ReNaLART. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd		Malik M.I., Sindhu M.A., Khattak A.S., Abbasi R.A., Saleem K.

152	Behave	Scenario-Based Microservice Retrieval Using Word2Vec	Microservice architecture (MSA) is an emerging software architectural style, which differs fundamentally from the monolithic, layered architecture. During the development and maintenance of microservice systems, how to provide an effective service retrieval mechanism is a critical challenge to avoid the problems of rework and duplicate code. Meanwhile, nowadays, using the BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) method to develop microservices becomes more and more popular due to its agility and domain-driven characteristics. BDD is an agile software development approach emphasizing that test cases are written in a common language to include scenarios that describe the features of a target system. In this paper, we propose an approach, referred to as SMSR (Scenario-based MicroService Retrieval), to recommend appropriate microservices to users based on the user-written BDD test scenarios. The proposed service retrieval algorithm is based on word2vec, a widely-used machine learning method in NLP (Natural Language Processing), to perform service filtering and service similarity calculation. Experiment results show that SMSR is able to effectively retrieve appropriate microservices from the service repository.

This work reports on preliminary attempts to automate the generation of test cases from software requirement models using an industrial case study. The requirements are represented using a modeling notation and test cases are automatically generated using model to text transformation techniques.	domain specific languages; model-based testing	Oyindamola Olajubu; Suraj Ajit; Mark Johnson; Scott Turner; Scott Thomson; Mark Edwards	RACS '15: Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on research in adaptive and convergent systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/2811411.2811555		505-508		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen			2	ACM		Automated Test Case Generation from Domain Specific Models of High-Level Requirements		Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
155	Behave	Towards a workflow for model-based testing of embedded systems	Model-based testing (MBT) has been previously used to validate embedded systems. However, (i) creation of a model conforming to the behavioural aspects of an embedded system, (ii) generation of executable test scripts and (iii) assessment of test verdict, re-quires a systematic process. In this paper, we have presented a three-phase tool-supported MBT workflow for the testing of an embedded system, that spans from requirements specification to test verdict assessment. The workflow starts with a simplistic, yet practical, application of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) based on Gherkin-like style, which allows the requirements engineer to specify requirements and to extract information about model elements(i.e. states and transitions). This is done to assist the graphical modelling of the complete system under test (SUT). Later stages of the workflow generates an executable test script that runs on a domain-specific simulation platform. We have evaluated this tool-supported workflow by specifying the requirements, extracting information from the DSL and developing a model of a subsystem of the train control management system developed at Alstom Transport AB in Sweden. The C# test script generated from the SUT model is successfully executed at the Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) execution platform and test verdicts are visualized as a sequence of passed and failed test steps.

156	Behave	Model-Based Testing in Practice: An Industrial Case Study using GraphWalker	Model-based testing (MBT) is a test design technique that supports the automation of software testing processes and generates test artefacts based on a system model representing behavioural aspects of the system under test (SUT). Previous research has shown some positive aspects of MBT such as low-cost test case generation and fault detection effectiveness. However, it is still a challenge for both practitioners and researchers to evaluate MBT tools and techniques in real, industrial settings. Consequently, the empirical evidence regarding the mainstream use, including the modelling and test case generation using MBT tools, is limited. In this paper, we report the results of a case study on applying GraphWalker, an open-source tool for MBT, on an industrial cyber-physical system (i.e., a Train Control Management System developed by Bombardier Transportation in Sweden), from modelling of real-world requirements and test specifications to test case generation. We evaluate the models of the SUT for completeness and representativeness, compare MBT with manual test cases written by practitioners using multiple attributes as well as share our experiences of selecting and using GraphWalker for industrial application. The results show that a model of the SUT created using both requirements and test specifications provides better understanding of the SUT from testers' perspective, making it more complete and representative than the model created based only on the requirements specification alone. The generated model-based test cases are longer in terms of the number of test steps, achieve better edge coverage and can cover requirements more frequently in different orders while achieving the same level of requirements coverage as manually created test cases.

157	Behave	Towards behavior driven operations (BDOps)	Modern Enterprise Software Systems entail many challenges such as availability, scalability, complexity and providing business agility. Ensuring the systems to be up and running for 24 × 7 has become a mandate for operations. Agile development has been adopted to keep pace with the demands of business and IT. Test Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD) are practices, which enable agile development. So far the agile approach has been limited to development. For ensuring business to be truly agile, we need to take forward the agile approach to operations. In this paper, we discuss the behavior driven approach for operations specifically on the core sub-systems like infrastructure provisioning, deployment and monitoring. We share our explorations and experiments with Behavior Driven Monitoring (BDM) and how the same can be adopted for infrastructure provisioning and deployment. We used Cucumber-Nagios to detect behavior of an enterprise application. We close this paper with a note on the benefits to busmess and IT showing its relevance to DevOps, Continuous Delivery and Cloud Computing.

158	Behave	Combining behaviour-driven development with scrum for software development in the education domain	Most of the Brazilian universities employ teaching-learning methodologies based on classic frontal lectures. The Medicine Programme of the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) is an exception, since it employs active learning methodologies. The Educational and Academic Management System for Courses Based on Active Learning Methodologies (EAMS-CBALM) was built and it is currently used to support this programme, and has been made available for other programmes as well. This system was developed using Scrum, but during its development project it was often necessary to reconsider system behaviour scenarios, and consequently the product backlog items, mainly due to poor communication between the Product Owner (PO) and the development team. This paper discusses a case study in which Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) has been used in combination with Scrum to redesign some EAMS-CBALM components. The paper demonstrates that the communication between the PO and the development team can be improved by using BDD as a communication platform to unambiguously define system requirements and automatically generate test suites. ©2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

159	Behave	Enterprise ontology-driven development	Most of the current techniques and approaches for user requirements specification have problems with capturing the appropriate context for development of enterprise information systems. Primarily, they are designed to capture the functional aspects of software rather than its relevancy to an enterprise. Transactions defined in the DEMO (Design & Engineering Methodology for Organizations) represent business activities in their existential essence without implementation details. Therefore, they are great candidates to be utilized for the initial development phase of enterprise information systems. The paper exemplifies how to specify software specification the using the DEMO transaction pattern and BDD (Behaviour-Driven Development) technique. This proposal resulted from a significant lack of direct utilization of ontology for enterprise information systems development. The major part of the paper gives a step-by-step explanation of how to integrate DEMO transaction patterns into initial BDD scenarios for the development of enterprise information systems. Such created scenarios provide a perfect guideline in the initial phase of information system development for enterprises. The created scenarios were verified using the domain specific language Gherkin and BDD framework Behat. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.		Matula J., Hunka F.

160	Behave	A Behavior-Based Ontology for Supporting Automated Assessment of Interactive Systems	Nowadays many software development frameworks implement Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) as a mean of automating the test of interactive systems under construction. Automated testing helps to simulate user's action on the User Interface and therefore check if the system behaves properly and in accordance to Scenarios that describe functional requirements. However, most of tools supporting BDD requires that tests should be written using low-level events and components that only exist when the system is already implemented. As a consequence of such low-level of abstraction, BDD tests can hardly be reused with diverse artifacts and with versions of the system. To address this problem, this paper proposes to raise the abstraction level by the means of a behavior-based ontology that is aimed at supporting test automation. The paper presents an ontology and an ontology-based approach for automating the test of functional requirements of interactive systems. With the help of a case study for the flight tickets e-commerce domain, we demonstrate how tests written using our ontology can be used to assess functional requirements using different artifacts, from low-fidelity to full-fledged UI Prototypes.

161	Behave	A Formal Ontology for Describing Interactive Behaviors and Supporting Automated Testing on User Interfaces	Nowadays many software development frameworks implement Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) as a mean of automating the test of interactive systems under construction. Automated testing helps to simulate user's actions on the User Interface and therefore check if the system behaves properly and in accordance to scenarios that describe functional requirements. However, tools supporting BDD run tests on implemented User Interfaces and are a suitable alternative for assessing functional requirements in later phases of the development process. However, even when BDD tests can be written in early phases of the development process they can hardly be used with specifications of User Interfaces such as prototypes. To address this problem, this paper proposes to raise the abstraction level of both system interactive behaviors and User Interfaces by means of a formal ontology that is aimed at supporting test automation using BDD. The paper presents an ontology and an ontology-based approach for automating the test of functional requirements of interactive systems. We demonstrate the feasibility of this ontology-based approach to assess functional requirements in prototypes and full-fledge applications through an illustrative case study of e-commerce applications for buying flight tickets. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.

162	Behave	Behavior Driven Development: Tools and Challenges	Nowadays testing usually applies Test Driven Development (TDD) which is an approach to software development in which developers write tests first which initially fail and by adding more application codes tests pass. However, the latest development in this field is an extension to Test Driven Development (TDD) which usually referred as Behavior Driven Development (BDD). As being a modified version of TDD, both the technologies have various similarities. Nevertheless, the differences are also not unnoticeable. Where BDD is more about communication and collaboration TDD is more about coders and coding. This paper focuses on the advantages and glitches of TDD which led to the development of along with the method of working of BDD and several tools along with their features and a comparison of their functionalities.

163	Behave	Behavior Driven Development Approach in the Modern Quality Control Process	Nowadays usually the Behavior Driven Development is the approach of choice for the quality control engineers, especially for the long-term projects with the big amount of the audits, because of its main advantage - clear test scenarios visualization and understanding for the not involved persons. However, this approach could not reach its maximum efficiency without proper usage, but the documentation covers only the high-level practices which are not always enough to write the good test scenarios. That is why it is needed to describe the best practices and techniques of the usage of behavior-driven development, formed with the experience of its use. These practices would help to create correct and well understandable behavior scenarios, with the ability to use them as part of the technical documentation. Behavior-driven development would be considered in the comparison with the test-driven development and the domain-driven design approaches - the other important strategies in the quality assurance process.	behaviour driven development;test driven development;quality control;gherkin;practice;technique;scenario;feature;keyword;step	Oleksandr Bezsmertnyi; Nataliia Golian; Vira Golian; Iryna Afanasieva	2020 IEEE International Conference on Problems of Infocommunications.

164	Behave	Behavior driven development for tests and verification	Nowadays, hardware is usually tested and verified at postdesign time. The bottom line is that more effort is spend in the validation phases than in the implementation, because it is harder to fix bugs in later design stages than during the implementation of the design. In contrast, test-first approaches such as test driven development (TDD) have become increasingly important for software development. Behavior driven development (BDD) extends TDD by using natural language style scenarios to describe tests. But both approaches miss formal verification methods which are very important in hardware design. This research project presents a new approach based on BDD that combines testing and verification seamlessly. © Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden 2015. All rights reserved.		Diepenbeck M.

Following the BDD methodology thoroughly, one would expect 100 % code coverage, since code is only written to make the test cases pass. However, as we show in an empirical study this expectation is not valid in practice. It becomes even worse in the process of development, i.e. the coverage decreases over time. To close the coverage gap, we sketch an algorithm that generates BDD-style scenarios based on uncovered code.		M. Diepenbeck; M. Soeken; D. Grobe; R.

167	Behave	Using gherkin to extract tests and monitors for safer medical device interaction design	Number entry systems on medical devices are safety critical and it is important to get them right. Interaction design teams can be multidisciplinary, and in this work we present a process where the requirements of the system are drawn up using a Controlled Natural Language (CNL) that is understandable by non-technical experts or clients. These CNL requirements can also be directly used by the Quality Assurance (QA) team to test the system and monitor whether or not the system runs as it should once deployed. Since commonly, systems are too complex to test all possible execution paths before deployment, monitoring the system at runtime is useful in order to check that the system is running correctly. If at runtime, it is discovered that an anomaly is detected, the relevant personnel is notified through a report in natural language.	medical devices; runtime verification; testing; user interfaces	Abigail Cauchi; Christian Colombo; Adrian Francalanza; Mark Micallef; Gordon Pace	EICS '16: Proceedings of the 8th ACM SIGCHI Symposium on Engineering Interactive Computing Systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/2933242.2935868		275-280		Included	Included	new_screen			2	ACM		Using Gherkin to Extract Tests and Monitors for Safer Medical Device Interaction Design		Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

Despite its importance in simplifying network management, intent specification is not yet standardized. In this work, we propose a northbound interface (NBI) for intent declaration, based on Behavior-Driven Development. In our approach, intents are specified in plain English and translated by our system into pre-compiled network policies, that are in turn, converted into low-level rules by the software-defined infrastructure e.g. an SDN controller. We demonstrated our behavior-driven approach with two practical use cases: service function chaining deployed on OpenStack, supported by both ONOS and Ryu controllers, and dynamic firewall programming. We also measured the overhead and response time of our NBI. We believe that our approach is far more general and paves the way for a more expressive and simplified northbound interface for intent-driven networking."

169	Behave	Feature-Trace:Generating Operational Profile and Supporting Testing Prioritization from BDD Features	Operational Profiles provide quantitative information about how the software will be used, which supports highlighting those software components more sensitive to reliability based on their profile usage. However, the generation of Operational Profiles usually requires a considerable team effort to liaise requirements specification until their reification into expected software artifacts. In this sense, it becomes paramount in the software life cycle the ability to seamlessly or efficiently perform traceability from requirement to code, embracing the testing process as a means to ensure that the requirements are satisfiably covered and addressed. In this work, we propose the Feature-Trace approach which merges the advantages of the Operational Profile and the benefits of the requirements-to-code traceability present in the BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) approach. The primary goal of our work is to use the BDD approach as an information source for the semi-automated generation of the Operational Profile. The proposed approach was evaluated on the Diaspora software, on a GitHub open source software. The case study revealed that the Feature-Trace approach is capable of extracting the operational profile seamlessly from the specified Diaspora's BDD features as well as obtaining and presenting vital information to guide the process of test cases prioritization.	behavior-driven development; operational profile; requirements traceability; testing	Rafael Fazzolino; Genaina Nunes Rodrigues	SBES '19: Proceedings of the XXXIII Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering	https://doi.org/10.1145/3350768.3350781		332-336		Included	Included	new_screen			2	ACM		Feature-Trace: Generating Operational Profile and Supporting Testing Prioritization from BDD Features		Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

171	Behave	A semantic wiki approach to enable behaviour driven requirements management	Poorly managed requirements are considered as one of the principal causes of projects failure and consequently companies struggle to find an effective solution for requirements elicitation and further management. The adoption of such solution becomes even more difficult when the collaboration between different departments (e.g. marketing and development) is necessary. To address this challenge, the authors propose a methodology for requirements management based on Semantic Wiki and Behaviour Driven Development (BDD). BDD allows developers and end-users to interoperate and encourages seamless collaboration between all project participants. It also certifies that requirements are treated properly by their associated developments through the connection of textual descriptions to functional tests. Semantic wikis can be an added value in requirements management due to their enhanced browser interface and collaborative knowledge sharing capability. They allow stakeholders to participate in requirements management independently of their location. This is of major importance to reduce the problem of lack of inputs from interested parties. Moreover, with semantic wikis adoption, end-users and ontologies can coexist in one system since wiki pages are presented in a human-readable format in parallel to their formal representation in ontologies. This knowledge representation supports companies' decision-making by allowing managers to prioritize implementations, to keep a trace of requirements evolution, and reuse implementations when new requirements enter the system.

172	Behave	Dynamic signal driving strategy based high speed and low powered dual edge triggered flip flop design used memory applications	Power utilization assumes a massive part in any of the integrated circuits, and it’s rundown as a standout amongst essential difficulties in the universal innovation guide into semiconductors. Generally in integrated circuit, flip-flop and clock distribution system consume a lot of energy since they make and utilize the most extreme number of internal transitions. In the clock distribution system, the clock signal circulates from a typical point to every one of the components that required for the circuit. However this capacity is more important to the synchronous framework, much consideration needs to provide for the attributes of these clock signals. In the sequential circuits, a clock distribution system spends a lot of power given the high operating frequency of high capacitance. An existing approach to reducing the limits of a clock signal is based on the quantity of clocked transistors. In this, an advanced procedure is proposed and evaluated by utilizing Dual-Edge Triggered Flip-Flop (DETFF) depends on the Dynamic Signal Driving (DSD) strategy. This DETFF is executed in sequential circuits that have been ordered using Tanner Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool which is used to simulate and examine control by using Dynamic Signal Driving (DSD) strategy. The outcomes demonstrate that the total power utilization is decreased in sequential benchmark circuit design. A number of Flip flops have been designed by various technologies such as reducing area, delay, and power, but this proposed dynamic signal driving scheme can be used for any integrated circuit- that can be reduced to all these three parameters to give the best trade-off for a particular ASIC platform.

174	Behave	Behavior-driven development in product configuration systems	Product Configuration Systems (PCS) are increasingly used by companies to automate the performance of the sales and engineering processes. Since the benefits from such projects have huge variations, it is crucial to make the right decisions when scoping and developing PCSs. The development of PCS is influenced by both business interests and technical insights. Developers of PCS face various challenges while working in team, including different stakeholders such as business owners, developers, project managers, and product experts. The more diverse the team is, the more significant are the challenges. This paper suggests that Behavior-driven Development (BDD) may provide configuration teams with a specific structure to express scenarios (and thus constraints) on PCS in natural language. BDD may yield benefits such as a better expression of PCS constraints, more efficient communication of requirements and incorporation of the expressed rules in a software transformation process. In other words, applying BDD may eliminate unnecessary tasks when gathering knowledge, developing, and testing PCS projects. In this paper, we present a novel approach from an ongoing project on how to relate BDD to the development process of PCS while using Scrum-based methods. © 2018 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

175	Behave	Light-weight software product lines for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)	Product line engineering practices promote the idea of systematic reuse of core assets and have been reported to decrease time-to-market and development costs for new products. However, our recent efforts to transfer our product line engineering knowledge to several of our small and medium-size enterprise industrial partner showed that there are challenges that need to be addressed before core product line engineering ideas can be deployed in SME context. These challenges include upfront investment costs, business traceability, levels of abstraction of functional features and semantic distinction between functional and non-functional software aspects. In order to address these challenges within the context of SMEs, we adopt and extend the behavior-driven development methodology in a way to not only offer agility in practice but also to equip software developers with the means to capture and manage software variability within the behavior-driven development process. We introduce the details of the extended methodology and discuss its advantages and disadvantages in detail.

176	Behave	Chapter 8 - Integrating Automation into Your Development Process	Publisher Summary The concept of continuous integration has been around for quite a while now. There are many tools to provide continuous integration and surprisingly, some even work together. Any investment in continuous integration will pay off but it requires discipline that few developers, QA resources, or management actually have at the start of the process. The challenge is to train the development staff and the QA to use continuous integration to work smarter, not harder. There is much interest in continuous integration, and many organizations are implementing continuous integration tools as part of their move to agile development. Difficulty surrounds this move because not only do developers have to change some working habits, but also there typically is a large investment required matching the capabilities of the tool to the organization itself and for that reason alone it is daunting. Many tools, whether they are open source or commercial products, exist for performing automation. The platform in use for development, including the operating system or the development environment platform, as well as the delivery platform of the end product, may restrict the selection of tools. Additionally, the software development language in use may dictate a narrow selection of tools. Some development shops may have restrictions regarding what software can be brought in due to security concerns.

177	Behave	Chapter 4.1 - The Psychology of Programming in the Large: Team and Organizational Behaviour	Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the psychology of programming in relation to team and organizational behavior. Software development must be studied at several behavioural levels. Organizing programmers into teams superimposes a layer of social behavior on the cognitive requirements of programming tasks. Two structures have been proposed for programming teams based on the centralized versus decentralized team organizations often studied in group dynamics research. A hybrid approach to structuring programming teams might be taken on large projects that have characteristics favourable to different types of programming teams. Programming team activities offer many opportunities for peer review activities that may be formal or informal components of the development process. On the other hand, team methodologies must focus on coordinating the tasks and product concept. The structure of programming teams should reflect the nature of the task rather than the organization, allow members to speak as if with one mind, and determine the tasks the team can effectively handle.

178	Behave	Intuitive design: framing a software test system as a status reporting tool for business	Purpose: This paper aims to present a conceptual framework of how software teams can leverage the implicit information of implemented acceptance tests to cater to the needs of decision makers. The research questions on this framework were how business stakeholders can receive project status information in an intuitive way and how this framework can guarantee the traceability of tests to requirements. Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual framework delineates the design of an acceptance test framework in three aspects: how the requirements model reflects the evolving states of requirement maturity over a project, how the acceptance test model becomes synchronized with the requirements model without a traceability matrix and how the acceptance test model communicates business value to the decision makers. Findings: In an industrial case study, the presented framework yielded the positive effects of intuitive understanding by business stakeholders, high test coverage of requirements and distinctly reduced manual quality assurance (QA) work by automated testing for browsers and mobile devices. Practical implications: The presented framework can help to convince business stakeholders to approve the budget for building a testing framework because it delivers them value as a status reporting tool. Originality/value: This paper is the first to describe a step-by-step approach to solving a critical problem that IT departments frequently face. The solution consists in a new way of transforming the perception of a technical framework into a reporting tool for business information by intuitive design. The idea of mapping hierarchically corresponding abstraction layers can be transferred to other engineering domains. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.		So C.

180	Behave	Modern and Responsive Mobile-enabled Web Applications	Rapid web technology improvements in the last few years have powered software developers to quickly write responsive mobile-friendly applications. The innovative web frameworks and libraries make it easy to have same software code base for desktop and mobile devices. Single-page applications offer a more-native-app-like experience to the user. This also means a web application can easily be converted to a native mobile application if desired. This allows software products to be evolved continuously at a much faster pace with features added on daily basis. The software companies who can adopt these technologies will most likely see the benefit in the long run as they can offer new and modified products faster than their competitors. In this paper, we review some of the state-of-the-art web technologies, third-party libraries, and frameworks for quick interactive web development. Finally, we present a simple interactive browser-based, mobile friendly web application which was developed using one of the latest web development framework.

182	Behave	A Requirement-based Regression Test Selection Technique in Behavior-Driven Development	Regression testing is an essential software maintenance activity before the release of a new version implementing a bug fix or a new feature. A regression test selection (RTS) technique chooses a subset of existing test cases to ensure that the system will not be adversely affected by the latest modifications. With the rise of DevOps, behavior-driven development (BDD) is growing in popularity as it is in close alignment with agile practices, for example, continuous integration. Hence, it is necessary to propose a novel and effective RTS technique for BDD specifically to accelerate the development process while ensuring software quality. Since most existing techniques for RTS are code-based and thus subject to some limitations, we present a requirement-based technique which uses the requirements in BDD to select test cases in both high-level (acceptance testing) and low-level (unit testing). Our technique firstly illustrates the new requirement with a scenario, and subsequently computes the semantic similarity of the new scenario and all existing scenarios with the vector space model. According to the results, the modification-traversing regression test cases can be selected in a semi-automated way. We also conduct an experimental study to evaluate our technique in terms of inclusiveness, precision, efficiency and generality. The study shows that our technique is applicable for BDD and effective in practice.	regression test selection;behavior-driven development;requirement-based technique;vector space model	Jincheng Xu; Qingfeng Du; Xiaojun Li	2021 IEEE 45th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)	https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSAC51774.2021.00182	"1.O.

183	Behave	Interface Responsibility Patterns:Processing Resources and Operation Responsibilities	Remote Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), as for instance offered in microservices architectures, are used in almost any distributed system today and are thus enablers for many digitalization efforts. It is hard to design such APIs so that they are easy and effective to use; maintaining their runtime qualities while preserving backward compatibility is equally challenging. Finding well suited granularities in terms of the architectural capabilities of endpoints and the read-write semantics of their operations are particularly important design concerns. Existing pattern languages have dealt with local APIs in object-oriented programming, with remote objects, with queue-based messaging and with service-oriented computing platforms. However, patterns or equivalent guidances for the architectural design of API endpoints, operations and their request and response message structures are still missing. In this paper, we extend our microservice API pattern language (MAP) and introduce endpoint role and operation responsibility patterns, namely Processing Resource, Computation Function, State Creation Operation, Retrieval Operation, and State Transition Operation. Known uses and examples of the patterns are drawn from public Web APIs, as well as application development and system integration projects the authors have been involved in.

184	Behave	A Conceptual Metamodel to Bridging Requirement Patterns to Test Patterns	Requirement patterns represent an abstraction of an application's behaviors and services that, in turn, may be replicated in similar applications. However, there has been a lack of efforts exploiting the benefits of requirement patterns in other phases of the software development life cycle, besides the requirements engineering itself. To address this gap, we propose the Software Pattern MetaModel (SoPaMM) that bridges requirement patterns to groups of scenarios with similar behaviors in the form of test patterns. SoPaMM allows the description of the behavior of a requirement pattern through a time executable and easy-to-use language aiming at the automatic generation of test patterns. Using SoPaMM, we model and implement a behavior-driven functional requirement pattern for a web-based user authentication application. Our preliminary results point out that a requirement pattern can be an executable specification capable of generating automated tests.	behavior; metamodeling; requirement pattern; reuse; test pattern	Taciana Novo Kudo; Renato F.

185	Behave	A Framework to Diminish the Gap between the Business Specialist and the Software Designer	"Requirements Engineering establishes the process for defining requirements as one in which elicitation, modeling and analysis are tasks which must be carried out. This process should involve different stakeholders and their different viewpoints. Among these stakeholders, there is the software designer, responsible for creating models based on the information gathered by business specialists. However, this communication channel may create some ""noise"" that leads to information being lost. This loss produces a semantic gap between what is desired and what will be developed. The semantic gap is characterized by inconsistencies in the requirements represented by scenarios–user stories in a behavior-driven context–and by the conceptual model. This paper presents an interactive approach to the agile requirements modeling, thus fostering greater consistency between the artifacts of the scenarios and the conceptual model. This consistency is ensured by using a mind model specification which will serve as a basis for transforming the definitions of the scenario and generating a conceptual model represented by a UML class diagram. The mind model represents the main role of this approach, and functions as a bond that represents the business entities, thus enabling the requirements to be more consistent with the reality of the business."

186	Behave	Using Behaviour-driven Requirements Engineering for Establishing and Managing Agile Product Lines: An Observational Study	Requirements engineering in agile product line engineering refers to both common and variability components establishing a software. Although it is conventional for the requirements engineering to take place in a dedicated upfront domain analysis phase, agile-based environments denounce such a proactive behaviour. This paper provides an observational study examining a reactive incremental requirement engineering approach called behaviour-driven requirements engineering. The proposed approach uses behaviour-driven development to establish and maintain agile product lines. The findings of the study are very promising and suggest the following: the approach is easy to understand and quick to learn; the approach supports the constantly changing nature of software development; and using behaviour-driven requirements engineering produces reliable and coherent requirements. In practice, the observational study showed that using the proposed approach saved time for development team and customers, decreased costs, improved the software quality, and shortened the time-to-market. © 2021.

An essential part of any software development process is quality assurance, so testing will be very important for RPA processes. However, the classical software techniques are not always suitable for the RPA software robots due to the mix of the graphical description of the robots and their implementations. In this short paper, we describe the state of the practice for testing of software robots and propose some ideas of test automation using model-based testing.

188	Behave	Agent-oriented software patterns for rapid and affordable robot programming	Robotic systems are often quite complex to develop; they are huge, heavily constrained from the non-functional point of view and they implement challenging algorithms. The lack of integrated methods with reuse approaches leads robotic developers to reinvent the wheel each time a new project starts. This paper proposes to reuse the experience done when building robotic applications, by catching it into design patterns. These represent a general mean for (i) reusing proved solutions increasing the final quality, (ii) communicating the knowledge about a domain and (iii) reducing the development time and effort. Despite of this generality, the proposed repository of patterns is specific for multi-agent robotic systems. These patterns are documented by a set of design diagrams and the corresponding implementing code is obtained through a series of automatic transformations. Some patterns extracted from an existing and freely available repository are presented. The paper also discusses an experimental set-up based on the construction of a complete robotic application obtained by composing some highly reusable patterns.

We suggest in this paper three potential issues with centralized implementations of LMSR, which we refer to as the availability, security, and privacy problems. We also explain how a permissioned blockchain-based implementation of LMSR effectively solves all the above problems. Following the design science research framework (Peffers et al., 2007), our main contribution is a fully functional permissioned blockchain-based implementation of LMSR that is ready to be deployed. We believe our results are of great value not only to prediction market researchers and practitioners looking for LMSR implementations, but also to blockchain professionals looking for fully developed solutions as well as applications of suitable research frameworks to guide blockchain research and development.

193	Behave	Introducing continuous experimentation in large software-intensive product and service organisations	Software development in highly dynamic environments imposes high risks to development organizations. One such risk is that the developed software may be of only little or no value to customers, wasting the invested development efforts. Continuous experimentation, as an experiment-driven development approach, may reduce such development risks by iteratively testing product and service assumptions that are critical to the success of the software. Although several experiment-driven development approaches are available, there is little guidance available on how to introduce continuous experimentation into an organization. This article presents a multiple-case study that aims at better understanding the process of introducing continuous experimentation into an organization with an already established development process. The results from the study show that companies are open to adopting such an approach and learning throughout the introduction process. Several benefits were obtained, such as reduced development efforts, deeper customer insights, and better support for development decisions. Challenges included complex stakeholder structures, difficulties in defining success criteria, and building experimentation skills. Our findings indicate that organizational factors may limit the benefits of experimentation. Moreover, introducing continuous experimentation requires fundamental changes in how companies operate, and a systematic introduction process can increase the chances of a successful start.

195	Behave	Behavior-Driven Development:A case study on its impacts on agile development teams	Software development practices which enhance software quality and help teams better develop collaboratively have received attention by the academic community. Among these techniques is Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), a development method which proposes software to be developed focusing primarily on its expected behavior. In this context, this paper investigates how BDD impacts agile software development teams. In order to achieve this, we have conducted a case study on a mobile application development environment which develops software using agile. In total, 42 interviews were performed. Our results indicate that BDD can have positive impacts, increasing collaboration among team members, and negative impacts, like difficulties in writing unit tests. We concluded that BDD has more positive than negative outcomes.	Agile Development; Behavior-Driven Development; Challenge Based Learning; Software Engineering	Nicolas Nascimento; Alan R.

196	Behave	Using grounded theory to understand software process improvement: A study of Irish software product companies	Software process improvement (SPI) aims to understand the software process as it is used within an organisation and thus drive the implementation of changes to that process to achieve specific goals such as increasing development speed, achieving higher product quality or reducing costs. Accordingly, SPI researchers must be equipped with the methodologies and tools to enable them to look within organisations and understand the state of practice with respect to software process and process improvement initiatives, in addition to investigating the relevant literature. Having examined a number of potentially suitable research methodologies, we have chosen Grounded Theory as a suitable approach to determine what was happening in actual practice in relation to software process and SPI, using the indigenous Irish software product industry as a test-bed. The outcome of this study is a theory, grounded in the field data, that explains when and why SPI is undertaken by the software industry. The objective of this paper is to describe both the selection and usage of grounded theory in this study and evaluate its effectiveness as a research methodology for software process researchers. Accordingly, this paper will focus on the selection and usage of grounded theory, rather than results of the SPI study itself.

197	Behave	Using spring Roo for the test-driven development of Web applications	Software should be developed in a way that achieves high external and internal quality. Most programs have to be maintained or are extended. They should not only adhere to their requirements but allow to be efficiently changed. Model-driven software development (MDSD) and test-driven development (TDD) are techniques that help to satisfy this demand. We present a novel approach combining MDSD and TDD while using the Spring Roo Web development framework. Besides discussing existing work and the background, we sketch a test-driven Web development process. We then evaluate its feasibility in an exemplary scenario. Thereby, we contribute to the body of scientific knowledge on Web development frameworks in the field of MDSD and TDD.

198	Behave	A Survey of Software Testing Practices in Canada	Software testing is an important activity in the software development life-cycle. In an earlier study in 2009, we reported the results of a regional survey of software testing practices among practitioners in the Canadian province of Alberta. To get a larger nationwide view on this topic (across Canada), we conducted a newer survey with a revised list of questions in 2010. Compared to our previous Alberta-wide survey (53 software practitioners), the nation-wide survey had larger number of participants (246 practitioners). We report the survey design, execution and results in this article. The survey results reveal important and interesting findings about software testing practices in Canada. Whenever possible, we also compare the results of this survey to other similar studies, such as the ones conducted in the US, Sweden and Australia, and also two previous Alberta-wide surveys, including our 2009 survey. The results of our survey will be of interest to testing professionals both in Canada and world-wide. It will also benefit researchers in observing the latest trends in software testing industry identifying the areas of strength and weakness, which would then hopefully encourage further industry-academia collaborations in this area. Among the findings are the followings: (1) the importance of testing-related training is increasing, (2) functional and unit testing are two common test types that receive the most attention and efforts spent on them, (3) usage of the mutation testing approach is getting attention among Canadian firms, (4) traditional Test-last Development (TLD) style is still dominating and a few companies are attempting the new development approaches such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), (5) in terms of the most popular test tools, NUnit and Web application testing tools overtook JUnit and IBM Rational tools, (6) most Canadian companies use a combination of two coverage metrics: decision (branch) and condition coverage, (7) number of passing user acceptance tests and number of defects found per day (week or month) are regarded as the most important quality assurance metrics and decision factors to release, (8) in most Canadian companies, testers are out-numbered by developers, with ratios ranging from 1:2 to 1:5, (9) the majority of Canadian firms spent less than 40% of their efforts (budget and time) on testing during development, and (10) more than 70% of respondents participated in online discussion forums related to testing on a regular basis.

200	Behave	The implementation of ATDD and BDD from Testing Perspectives	Software testing is one of the stages in software development that aims to ensure that the software is built to meet the specifications. Selection of selective test cases has a great chance of finding failure. Black box testing approach is done based on the requirement specification where this approach does not pay attention to the program code but the specification of a software. This approach can be used for testing a software using ATDD (Acceptance Test Driven Development) and BDD (Behavior Driven Development) methods. ATDD is a method of building a software created based on agile principle, acceptance test created by customer, developer and tester. BDD is a growing agile development approach in recent years. Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is built on Test-Driven Development (TDD). This Final Project focuses on the application of ATDD and BDD methods to testing the final three projects of IT Del students tested using the Roboy Framework and Cucumber Framework to find out whether these two methods are effective and be able to improve the software development process. The results obtained are that the application of ATDD and BDD methods are effective and helping to remove the error as soon as possible. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

This mismatch requirement can be captured during the testing. Even then if it is missing it is because of non-coverage of the testing and test cases. This could be resolved by creating the unit test cases / Integration test cases from the requirements. This paper focuses on BDD requirements which generates the test cases as well as report executed. With aid of automation testing, the test cases of BDD can be explained.

207	Behave	BeSoS: A Tool for Behavior-driven and Scenario-based Requirements Modeling for Systems of Systems	Systems of Systems (SoS), like connected vehicle systems, provide their functionality by the interaction of several constituent systems (CSs). [Problem] Due to the managerial, operational and evolutionary independence of the CSs in an SoS, requirements constantly change over time and linear, top-down requirements engineering methods cannot be applied without significant adaptations. New tools are needed that support the continuous and iterative specification and alignment of requirements across different levels of abstraction. [Principal Ideas] We propose to integrate the behavior-driven development (BDD) approach with an intuitive and executable scenario-based modeling of functional requirements. In this way, stakeholder expectations can be structured via features and documented in natural language as usage scenarios. Based on usage scenarios, the modeling of functional requirements can be driven by tests, allowing for the automated testing and analysis of requirements. This in turn supports the iterative specification of requirements and the alignment of stakeholder needs. [Contribution] In this paper we showcase the tool BeSoS that supports the iterative and behavior-driven specification of requirements in an SoS context. We propose a method and describe its tool components using an example. The tool is available here: https://vimeo.com/512739942. © 2021 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.		Wiecher C., Greenyer J.

208	Behave	Behavior-Driven Development:An Expert Panel to evaluate benefits and challenges	"Teaching modern software techniques is a challenging task as these practices tend to be collaborative and require a lot of preparation and environment setup. Among these techniques is Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), a development method which proposes software to be develop focusing primarily on its expected behavior. In this context, this paper investigates the perception of active-learning experts regarding the potential benefits and challenges of teaching BDD in active learning environments to software engineering students. To achieve this goal, we have conducted an expert panel with 28 active-learning experts from four countries. Our preliminary results indicate that experts perceive both benefits, like improvement in specification, and challenges to embrace the BDD ""culture"" when teaching BDD to software engineering students. Based in these findings, we found indicatives that BDD should benefit software engineering students in active learning environments, however it may require more setup, teacher preparation and engagement during the learning process."

209	Behave	Testing meets static and runtime verification	Test driven development (TDD) is a technique where test cases are used to guide the development of a system. This technique introduces several advantages at the time of developing a system, e.g. writing clean code, good coverage for the features of the system, and evolutionary development. In this paper we show how the capabilities of a testing focused development methodology based on TDD and model-based testing, can be enhanced by integrating static and runtime verification into its workflow. Considering that the desired system properties capture data- as well as control-oriented aspects, we integrate TDD with (static) deductive verification as an aid in the development of the data-oriented aspects, and we integrate model-based testing with runtime verification as an aid in the development of the control-oriented aspects. As a result of this integration, the proposed development methodology features the benefits of TDD and model-based testing, enhanced with, for instance, early detection of bugs which may be missed by TDD, regarding data aspects, and the validation of the overall system with respect to the model, regarding the control aspects.

212	Behave	Assessing Agile Testing Practices for Enterprise Systems:A Survey Approach	"Testing enterprise systems is a challenging task. In this context, besides considering user requirements and business rules, there are several concerns that must also be considered when designing a test suite, including user interaction, integration with legacy systems, and access to relational or non-relational databases. In addition, test engineers often have to decide whether to test in the different levels (e.g., unit, integration, and system testing) or not, whether to use mock objects or not, and so on. Sadly, these decisions often conflict to each other. In this paper, we report an 18-month experience on using different approaches and tools to test two enterprise systems (SISBOL and SISDOT) from the Brazilian Army. SISBOL is an enterprise system based on the REST architectural style, using JEE (Java Enterprise Edition) in the business and integration tiers and AngularJS in the presentation tier. On the other hand, SISDOT is a ""pure"" Java enterprise system, using Java Server Faces on the presentation tier. We found that using executable specifications (as recommended in approaches based on Behavior Driven Development) is not only valid in test first scenarios as well as giving confidence on the system requirements validation, but they also help to identify new execution paths when the source code had been already implemented---suggesting that it is also promising to introduce a BDD approach in later stages of the development than testing pure JEE systems at the integration level."

213	Behave	Distributed agile: Component-based user acceptance testing	Testing is conducted at multiple levels during the development of software. User Acceptance Testing conforms that the software meets user's criteria. In this paper, User Acceptance Testing is automatically conducted based on acceptance criteria. The acceptance criteria are written in the form of Given-When-Then Template. These acceptance criteria are broken down into steps and numbered. The dependencies among the steps are determined as Given->When->Then. Henceforth, the steps are arranged in a dependency graph. This graph further leads to the creation of a decision table in which the outcome of one step leads to the outcomes of its dependent steps. The decision table forms the basis of generation of a binary weighted dependency tree. This tree becomes the means to form test coverage (number of combinations to test) which forms the basis of generation of acceptance test cases.		P. Pandit; S. Tahiliani; M.

215	Behave	A study of value in agile software development organizations	The Agile manifesto focuses on the delivery of valuable software. In Lean, the principles emphasise value, where every activity that does not add value is seen as waste. Despite the strong focus on value, and that the primary critical success factor for software intensive product development lies in the value domain, no empirical study has investigated specifically what value is. This paper presents an empirical study that investigates how value is interpreted and prioritised, and how value is assured and measured. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with 23 participants from 14 agile software development organisations. The contribution of this study is fourfold. First, it examines how value is perceived amongst agile software development organisations. Second, it compares the perceptions and priorities of the perceived values by domains and roles. Third, it includes an examination of what practices are used to achieve value in industry, and what hinders the achievement of value. Fourth, it characterises what measurements are used to assure, and evaluate value-creation activities.

216	Behave	User and System Stories: An Agile Approach for Managing Requirements in AOSE	The agile software development life cycle is widely used in industry today due to its highly flexible and iterative processes that facilitate rapid prototyping. There has been recent work in bringing concepts and processes from agile methodologies to agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE). We contribute to this effort by presenting in this paper a novel approach to capturing requirements of agent systems in AOSE using and extending agile concepts. In this paper, we propose to adopt and extend the well-known concept of User Stories to facilitate the development of agent systems. We introduce a novel concept, System Story, that defines requirements from the perspective of the system. These System Stories are refinements of User Stories and provide more intuitive mappings to agent concepts in the design and implementation. We show how our approach allows better traceability of requirements between stories and the different software development artifacts. We validate our proposal with a feature-based comparison to recent related work, and a preliminary user evaluation based on a drone simulation of a simple search and rescue case study.

217	Behave	The Art of Rails (Programmer to Programmer)	The Art of Rails(r) Any programmer knows that an API is only half the story, and with Ruby on Rails(r) this is especially true. Good Rails development, like good web development, is much more about the design choices you make than the framework you have at your disposal. Written by an experienced web application developer, this book picks up where the API leaves off and explains how to take good Rails code and turn it into beautiful Rails code: simple, effective, reusable, evolvable code. In a blend of design and programming, this book identifies and describes the very latest in design patterns, programming abstractions, and development methodologies that have emerged for the modern web. Ruby on Rails offers a completely new way of thinking about and using these emerging techniques, and learning to think like a Rails developer will enable you to rapidly design and write high-quality code with elegance and maintainability. With each design technique, you will discover how Rails incorporates it into its domain-specific language, and you will learn how to weave it seamlessly into your own Rails applications. Then you will learn how to take the next step and transform yourself from user into creator, making your own additions to Rails and crafting a development environment tailored to your specific needs. What you will learn from this book * Techniques for organizing your code between and within Model, View, and Controller to eliminate code repetition and maximize your effectiveness * How to think like a REST-based developer and use Rails 2.0 to translate these thoughts into your code * Advanced Ruby and meta-programming: how to use features such as block-based development, monkey patching, and dynamic APIs to build your own additions to the Rails framework * Design patterns for AJAX, web APIs, HTML decomposition, schema development, meta-programming, and more * Behavior-driven development: A new style of testing and development centered arou nd stories and behaviors instead of method calls and assertions * Ways to make your development both productive and fun in the software you write Who this book is for This book is for developers familiar with Ruby on Rails who are looking to advance their skills by learning the design and coding techniques that enable a mastery of web application development with Rails. Wrox guides are crafted to make learning programming languages and technologies easier than you think. Written by programmers for programmers, they provide a structured, tutorial format that will guide you through all the techniques involved.		Benson, Edward						Excluded	Excluded	new_screen			2

219	Behave	A User‐Centered Behavioral Software Development Model	The concept of usability, which affects the quality and cost of the software projects, has become essential in recent years. There is a need to integrate usability testing activities and techniques into the development processes; however, integration is difficult. Therefore, this study proposes user‐centered behavioral (UCB) software development model, which aims to bridge the gap between human–computer interaction (HCI) and software engineering (SE) disciplines. A triangulation methodology of mixed methods is used to understand the current situation in software development companies in terms of usability and user‐centered software development by survey and interviews. Their results are then used to inform the development of the proposed model. The UCB software development model proposes a process in which several tools and techniques from SE and HCI are integrated to facilitate the production of highly usable software. In essence, the model proposes an iterative process that combines behavior‐driven development (BDD)—an agile approach that enables a better understanding and analysis of the requirements—with the style guides, usability tests, heuristic evaluation, and Wizard of Oz techniques of HCI. The model was evaluated in a pilot project and then is improved based on feedback gathered. Participants' feedback supported the effectiveness of the proposed model.The UCB software development model proposes a process in which several tools and techniques from SE and HCI are integrated to create a model that will facilitate the production of highly usable software.

222	Behave	Behaviour driven development for tests and verification	The design of hardware systems is a challenging and error-prone task, where a signifcant portion of the effort is spent for testing and verification. Usually testing and verification are applied as a post-process to the implementation. Meanwhile, for the development of software, test-first approaches such as test driven development (TDD) have become increasingly important. In this paper, we propose a new design flow based on behaviour driven development (BDD), an extension of TDD, where acceptance tests written in natural language drive the implementation. We extend this idea by allowing the specification of properties in natural language and use them as a starting point in the design flow. The flow also includes an automatic generalisation of test cases to properties that are used for formal verification. In this way, testing and formal verification are combined in a seamless manner, while keeping the requirements - from which both tests and formal properties are derived - in a single consistent document. The approach has been implemented and evaluated on several examples to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed flow. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

223	Behave	The ASSERT Virtual Machine: A Predictable Platform for Real-Time Systems	The development of real-time control systems is a complex process which has to face often conflicting requirements, especially those related to the performance of the control methods and the real-time behaviour of the system. The ASSERT Virtual Machine provides a reliable execution platform for such systems, which allows developers to cope with functional and real-time aspects separately. In order to guarantee the required real-time properties, the virtual machine only accepts software components which have a predictable temporal behaviour which can be analysed at system design time. Such components can be automatically generated from a high-level description of a system which embodies the functional components (e.g. control algorithms) into a set of containers providing the appropriate concurrent and realtime behaviour. The ASSERT Virtual Machine has been implemented in Ada 2005, using a predictable tasking subset of the language known as the Ravenscar profile. A prototype has been validated on several pilot-scale spacecraft control systems, with good results.

224	Behave	Scenarios in the loop:integrated requirements analysis and automotive system validation	The development of safety-relevant systems in the automotive industry requires the definition of high-quality requirements and tests for the coordination and monitoring of development activities in an agile development environment. In this paper we describe a Scenarios in the Loop (SCIL) approach. SCIL combines (1) natural language requirements specification based on Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with (2) formal and test-driven requirements modeling and analysis, and (3) integrates discipline-specific tools for software and system validation during development. A central element of SCIL is a flexible and executable scenario-based modeling language, the Scenario Modeling Language for Kotlin (SMLK). SMLK allows for an intuitive requirements formalization, and supports engineers to move iteratively, and continuously aided by automated checks, from stakeholder requirements to the validation of the implemented system. We evaluated the approach using a real example from the field of e-mobility.

225	Behave	Continuous Security through Integration Testing in an Electronic Health Records System	The estimated average cost of a healthcare data breach in 2019 was $6.45 million, which is the highest among all industries. Yet, security remains an afterthought in many digital health applications. Formal methods for testing for bugs are commonplace in software development through the use of unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. More so, in modern software engineering, continuous integration is a well-known concept to run automated tests soon after any code change, when the system builds and notifies the development team of the test results. In this paper, we describe the use of a popular Python unit testing framework to implement a formal method of security testing. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is used to calculate metrics that represent the state of security of a deployed system. We developed a series of Pytest Behavioral Driven Development (BDD) scripts to test the Authentication and Availability of a widely used Electronic Health Records System called OpenMRS. The advantage of using the BDD approach is that testing scripts, called Gherkin files, can be read, and understood by the developers as well as the non-developer stakeholders. The use of Gherkin serves two purposes: firstly, it serves as the project’s documentation, and secondly, it automates the tests. The use of the CVSS score between 0 to 10 becomes an objective metric to compare every code change, thus achieving continuous security. We plan to expand BDD scripts to attacks like Denial of Service, Session Hijacking, SQL Injection, and other privilege escalation attacks.

226	Behave	Design Driven Testing: Test Smarter, Not Harder	The groundbreaking book Design Driven Testing brings sanity back to the software development process by flipping around the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD)restoring the concept of using testing to verify a design instead of pretending that unit tests are a replacement for design. Anyone who feels that TDD is Too Damn Difficult will appreciate this book. Design Driven Testing shows that, by combining a forward-thinking development process with cutting-edge automation, testing can be a finely targeted, business-driven, rewarding effort. In other words, youll learn how to test smarter, not harder. Applies a feedback-driven approach to each stage of the project lifecycle. Illustrates a lightweight and effective approach using a core subset of UML. Follows a real-life example project using Java and Flex/ActionScript. Presents bonus chapters for advanced DDTers covering unit-test antipatterns (and their opposite, test-conscious design patterns), and showing how to create your own test transformation templates in Enterprise Architect. What youll learn Create unit and behavioral tests using JUnit, NUnit, FlexUnit. Generate acceptance tests for all usage paths through use case thread expansion. Generate requirement tests for functional requirements. Run complex acceptance tests across the enterprise. Isolate individual control points for self-contained unit/behavioral tests. Apply Behavior Driven Development frameworks like JBehave and NBehave Design Driven Testing should appeal to developers, project managers, testers, business analysts, architectsin fact anyone who builds software that needs to be tested. While equally applicable on both large and small projects, Design Driven Testing is especially helpful to those developers who need to verify their software against formal requirements. Such developers will benefit greatly from the rational and disciplined approach espoused by the authors.		Stephens, Matt; Rosenberg, Doug						Excluded	Excluded	new_screen			2						
227	Behave	Development of health software using behaviour driven development - BDD	The health software industry is facing an immense challenge of managing quality and preventing software failures. Poorly defined requirements are one of the significant cause of health software failures. Agile practices are being increasingly used by the software industry to develop systems on time and within budget with improved software quality and user acceptance. Behaviour-driven development (BDD) is an agile software engineering practice that can help to improve health software quality vastly. BDD achieves this by prioritising the illustration of software's behaviour using ubiquitous language, followed by automated acceptance testing to assess if the illustrated behaviour was achieved. This paper presents a review of BDD literature, including the characteristics of BDD and examines how BDD can benefit health software quality. The paper reviews health software standards and guidelines, to examine their compatibility with a BDD approach. Finally, the paper details future plans for the development of a framework that provides health software companies with a detailed step by step guideline on how to use BDD to develop safer health software.

228	Behave	Behaviour-driven development applied to the conformance testing of INSPIRE web services	The implementation of the INSPIRE directive requires to check the conformity of a large number of network services with the implementing rules of INSPIRE. The evaluation whether a service is fully conformant with INSPIRE is complex and requires the use of specialized testing tools that should report how verification has been made and should identify non-conformances. The use of these tools requires a high degree of technical knowledge. This fact makes very difficult for non-technical stakeholders (end users, managers, domain experts, etc.) to participate effectively in conformance testing, hinders stakeholders understanding of the causes and consequences of non-conformant results and may cause in some stakeholders disinterest in conformance testing. This work explores the suitability of a behaviour-driven development (BDD) approach to the conformance testing of OGC Web services in the context of the INSPIRE directive. BDD emphasizes the participation of non-technical parties in the design of acceptance tests by means of automatable abstract tests expressed in a human readable format. Using this idea as base, this work describes a BDD based workflow to derive abstract test suites and executable test suites from INSPIRE implementation requirements that can be written in the language used by non-technical stakeholders. This work also analyses if BDD and popular BDD tools, such as Gherkin and Cucumber, are compatible with ISO 19105:2000 testing methodology. As demonstration, we present an online conformance tool for INSPIRE View and Discovery services that executes BDD test suites. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

229	Behave	Towards a Thing-In-the-Loop approach for the Verification and Validation of IoT systems	The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly increasing its diffusion, posing great challenges to the research community. IoT systems are composed by smart objects (Things) that are interconnected in order to provide new products and services. The interaction of heterogeneous and distributed smart things guided by software with the physical world brings new sources of safety issues. To this reason, providing valuable and effective solutions to support the verification and validation of such systems is needed. In this paper we introduce a model-driven Thing-In-the-Loop verification and validation approach that transfers the best practices adopted in different embedded system domains towards the IoT world. Starting from models and scenarios representing the structure and behaviors of the IoT system as well as models of its context our approach generates appropriate test cases that are executed in accordance with Model-in-the-Loop, Software-in-the-Loop and Hardware-in-the-Loop techniques. We preliminarily evaluated the feasibility of our approach by applying it in the context of a Smart Mobility case study.

230	Behave	Supporting smart construction with dependable edge computing infrastructures and applications	The Internet of Things (IoT) such as the use of robots, sensors, actuators, electronic signalization and a variety of other Internet enabled physical devices may provide for new advanced smart applications to be used in construction in the very near future. Such applications require real-time responses and are therefore time-critical. Therefore, in order to support collaboration, control, monitoring, supply management, safety and other construction processes, they have to meet dependability requirements, including requirements for high Quality of Service (QoS). Dependability and high QoS can be achieved by using adequate number and quality of computing resources, such as processing, memory and networking elements, geographically close to the smart environments. The goal of this study is to develop a practical edge computing architecture and design, which can be used to support smart construction environments with high QoS. This study gives particular attention to the solution design, which relies on latest cloud and software engineering approaches and technologies, and provides elasticity, interoperability and adaptation to companies' specific needs. Two edge computing applications supporting video communications and construction process documentation are developed and demonstrate a viable edge computing design for smart construction.

231	Behave	Towards behavior-driven graphical user interface testing	The majority of users interacts with an application through its graphical user interface (GUI). To ensure high quality and expected behavior, those graphical user interfaces have to be tested thoroughly. Yet, creating graphical user interface test cases is considered expensive in comparison to unit or integration tests. In addition, test cases are perceived to be expensive to run and brittle, therefore causing a lot of false negative test results. Behavior-driven test case design addresses this challenges by bringing requirement specifications and test cases closer together. Although industry-proven tools map test specifications automatically, test methods making test scripts executable need to be implemented manually. The specification language Slang introduced by this paper generates automatically executable test cases from BDD-like feature descriptions that integrate low-fidelity prototypes in form of wireframesketcher models. To quantify the economic advantage of our approach an AB/BA crossover designed experiment was conducted. The experiment showed that creating automatically executable test cases utilizing Slang takes 63% less time compared to the industry-proven tool JBehave. In addition to presenting the experiment's results, the paper elaborates on first experience from applying the approach in a large Swiss bank. The findings of our experiments are supported by results from applying our approach in real-world scenarios. In addition, experiment as well as case study participants appreciated the sophisticated editor support of Slang.

232	Behave	The behavior driven development applied to the software quality test: A case study applied to the promotion of sports financing in Brazil	The mechanisms of private investment in Brazilian sport are one of the main sources of resources that athletes hold to promote participation in high-performance competitions. In order to improve this flow, softwares are designed to shorten the path between donors and recipients. These tools, such as 'Meu Campeãu' used in this paper, require efficient analysis of the quality of the product offered. Concepts known as agile methodologies have brought a new style to the analysis of the software developed, and one of them has gained considerable prominence, known such as BDD (Behavior Driven Development), so this paper aims to analyze the implementation of Behavior Driven Development in the software quality verification process 'Meu Campeãu'. © 2019 AISTI.

233	Behave	Graph-based and scenario-driven microservice analysis, retrieval, and testing	The microservice architecture (MSA) differs fundamentally from the monolithic, layered architecture. The use of microservices provides a high degree of autonomy, composability, scalability, and fault-tolerance. MSA is regarded by many as a promising architecture for smart-city applications; however, a number of issues remain, including (1) the management of complex call relationships among microservices; (2) ensuring the quality of the overall software system even as new microservices are added and existing ones are modified, and (3) locating existing microservices that satisfy new requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the development of microservice-based systems, referred to as GSMART (Graph-based and Scenario-driven Microservice Analysis, Retrieval and Testing). GSMART enables the automatic generation of a “Service Dependency Graph (SDG)” by which to visualize and analyze dependency relationships between microservices as well as between services and scenarios. It also enables the automatic retrieval of test cases required for system changes to reduce the time and costs associated with regression testing. A microservice retrieval method using VSM and word2vec accelerates the development of new microservices tailored specifically to the needs of users based on user-provided scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness, and efficiency of all of the main features of GSMART.

250	Behave	A Service Framework for Parallel Test Execution on a Developer's Local Development Workstation	The proliferation of distributed microservices driven by service oriented architecture and the effectiveness of agile software development processes such as Test Driven Development (TDD), Behavior Driven Development (BDD), inspired by extreme programming (XP), have driven the challenging necessity to receive prompt test feedback during software development iteratively. Although few test frameworks can execute unit tests in memory in parallel, no existing test frameworks can reliably perform parallel execution for the tests that rely on file system access, database fixtures and network communication. Isolated test execution environment with dedicated resources is a prerequisite to address these challenges. No previous research addresses this need to run groups of tests in parallel on the same development host. In this paper, to cut down test execution time, we present a service framework for parallel tests execution in a developer's containerized sandbox using operating system level virtualization provided by Docker, the new hot driver for Platform as a Service (PaaS).	agile development; cloud testing; Docker; parallel testing; test execution environment	Mazedur Rahman; Zehua Chen; Jerry Gao	2015 IEEE Symposium on Service-Oriented System Engineering	https://doi.org/10.1109/SOSE.2015.45	"1.M.

251	Behave	A Systematic Literature Review on Quality Criteria for Agile Requirements Specifications	The quality of requirements is typically considered as an important factor for the quality of the end product. For traditional up-front requirements specifications, a number of standards have been defined on what constitutes good quality : Requirements should be complete, unambiguous, specific, time-bounded, consistent, etc. For agile requirements specifications, no new standards have been defined yet, and it is not clear yet whether traditional quality criteria still apply. To investigate what quality criteria for assessing the correctness of written agile requirements exist, we have conducted a systematic literature review. The review resulted in a list of 16 selected papers on this topic. These selected papers describe 28 different quality criteria for agile requirements specifications. We categorize and analyze these criteria and compare them with those from traditional requirements engineering. We discuss findings from the 16 papers in the form of recommendations for practitioners on quality assessment of agile requirements. At the same time, we indicate the open points in the form of a research agenda for researchers working on this topic .

253	Behave	Using executable specification and regression testing for broadcast mechanism of visual programming language on smartphones	The rapid advancement of mobile computing technology and the rising usage of mobile apps made our daily life more productive. The mobile app should operate all the time bug-free in order to improve user satisfaction and offers great business value to the end user. At the same time, smartphones are full of special features that make testing of apps more challenging. Actually, the quality is a must for successful applications and it cannot be achieved without testing and verification. In this paper, we present the behavior driven development methodology and Cucumber framework to automate regression testing for Android apps. Particularly, the proposed methods use the visual programming language for smartphones (Catrobat) as a reference. The Catrobat program scripts communicate via a broadcast mechanism. The objective is to test the broadcast mechanism from different angles and track regression errors as well as specify and diagnose bugs with the help of executable specifications. The results show that the methods are able to effectively reveal deficiencies in the broadcast mechanism, and ensure that the app meets end users' expectations and needs. © 2018, International Association of Online Engineering.

255	Behave	The impact of tailoring criteria on agile practices adoption: A survey with novice agile practitioners in Brazil	The software development industry adopts agile methods in different ways by considering contextual requirements. To fulfill organizational needs, adoption strategies consider agile methods tailoring. However, tailoring according to the context of the organization remains a problem to be solved. Literature on criteria for adopting software development methods exists, but not specifically for agile methods. Given this scenario, the following research question arises: what is the impact of software method tailoring criteria on the adoption of agile practices? To answer this question, we conducted a survey among agile practitioners in Brazil to gather data about importance of the tailoring criteria and agile practices adopted. A model for agile practices adoption based on the tailoring criteria is proposed using the results of the survey with a majority of novice agile practitioners. The proposed model was validated using PLS-SEM (partial least squares structural equation modeling) and the survey data. Results show that adoption of agile practices was influenced by criteria such as external environment, previous knowledge and internal environment. Results also indicate that organizations tend to use hybrid/custom software methods and select agile practices according to their needs.

256	Behave	Rules of thumb to increase the software quality through testing	The software maintenance typically requires 40-80% of the overall project costs, and this considerable variability mostly depends on the software internal quality: the more the software is designed and implemented to constantly welcome new changes, the lower will be the maintenance costs. The internal quality is typically enforced through testing, which in turn also affects the development and maintenance costs. This is the reason why testing methodologies have become a major concern for any company that builds - or is involved in building - software. Although there is no testing approach that suits all contexts, we infer some general guidelines learned during the Development of the Italian Single-dish COntrol System (DISCOS), which is a project aimed at producing the control software for the three INAF radio telescopes (the Medicina and Noto dishes, and the newly-built SRT). These guidelines concern both the development and the maintenance phases, and their ultimate goal is to maximize the DISCOS software quality through a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) workflow beside a continuous delivery pipeline. We consider different topics and patterns; they involve the proper apportion of the tests (from end-to-end to low-level tests), the choice between hardware simulators and mockers, why and how to apply TDD and the dependency injection to increase the test coverage, the emerging technologies available for test isolation, bug fixing, how to protect the system from the external resources changes (firmware updating, hardware substitution, etc.) and, eventually, how to accomplish BDD starting from functional tests and going through integration and unit tests. We discuss pros and cons of each solution and point out the motivations of our choices either as a general rule or narrowed in the context of the DISCOS project. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

257	Behave	Automated testing framework development based on social interaction and communication principles	The speed of development of the IT industry as well as the computational power which are increasing exponentially, create great competitiveness in the process of development but also in the launching of software products on the market. Automated testing comes to help with these challenges by trying to increase the speed of development by offering fast feedback and trustworthy quality by means of repeated runs of the implemented tests. This isn't a problem just on a technical level, but also on a social level, especially in the area of communication and understanding the requirements of the client. This work presents the implementation of an automated testing framework which also addresses the social problems. BDD or “Behavior Driven Development” includes an approach which would like to line up the area of client requests to the technical area, offering a uniform platform of collaboration and development. The implementation of this principle is applied in an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) type project which is meant to demonstrate the technical solution which may draw together, both socially and communication wise, the business teams and the technical implementation teams.	testing process;BDD;automated testing;Gherkin language	A.

258	Behave	Enabling faith-inspired education on the sustainable development goals through e-learning	The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are composed from a variety of universal goals. They come with a heavy load on ethical demands while they do not provide any ethical guidance. One possibility to fill this void is to teach the SDGs with a faith-based narrative. Grown out of a workshop by Bread for World we will present our approach of Ownership-inspired Behavior-driven development, which is a strategy for an e-learning governance to introduce an Android app to support e-learning on the SDGs in theological education in remote areas in the Global South. Our goal is to develop a governance strategy for higher theological education to fill the SDGs with a faith-based narrative by using e-learning technology. Based on the staircase curriculum for the education of future church leaders developed by the British FBO Relay Trust we introduce the theoretical framework for this goal, which makes the transfer from a hierarchical governance structure found in many African societies into a dynamic e-learning framework. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

This method will successively refine a list of high-level business goals into an Event-B model using transformations.

260	Behave	Using behaviour-driven development with hardware-software co-design for autonomous load management	The typical approach to designing embedded systems manages the specification and design of the hardware and software separately. HW/SW Co-design is used, in embedded computing, to allow the hardware and the software to be designed and implemented together and make sure that the non-functional properties are met. Behavior-driven development (BDD) is an agile software development approach that spurs collaboration of project stakeholders to ensure the right software is developed to meet their needs. BDD describes the behavior of the system as executable user stories and focuses on how the system behaves for users interact with the system. In this paper, we introduce an approach that integrates BDD with HW/SW Co-design. The approach provides the ability to describe the behavior of the software as executable user stories in a HW/SW Co-design environment. The approach is evaluated using a renewable energy project in collaboration with a private company in Canada to build a system for autonomous load management of self-forming renewable energy nanogrids.

261	Behave	Towards automated requirements checking throughout development processes of interactive systems	The user-centered development process of interactive systems is iterative and, during multiple iterations, users have the opportunity to bring new requirements that are very likely to have an impact, not only in future development, but also affect previously developed artifacts. Manual testing of all artifacts when new requirements are introduced can be cumbersome and time consuming. For that, we need flexible methods to ensure continuous consistency and accuracy among the various artifacts employed to build interactive systems. The ultimate goal of this position paper is to briefly present our vision on an approach for automating the requirements assessment using a Behavior-Driven Development perspective. Thereby, automated tests can run early in the design process, providing a continuous quality assurance of requirements, and helping clients and teams to identify potential problems and inconsistencies before commitments with software implementation.

262	Behave	Automated Test Input Generation via Model Inference Based on User Story and Acceptance Criteria for Mobile Application Development	"There has been observed explosive growth in the development of mobile applications (apps) for Android and iOS operating systems, which has led to the direct impact towards mobile app development. In order to design and propose quality-oriented apps, it is the primary responsibility of developers to devote time and sufficient efforts towards testing to make the apps bug-free and operational in the hands of end-users without any hiccup. Manual testing procedures take a prolonged amount of time in writing test cases, and in some cases, the full testing requirements are not met. Besides, the insufficient knowledge of tester also impacts the overall quality and bug-free apps. To overcome the obstacles of testing, we propose a new testing methodology cum tool called ""AgileUATM"" which works primarily towards white-box and black-box testing. To evaluate the validity of the proposed tool, we put the tool in a real-time operational environment concerning mobile test apps. By using this tool, all the acceptance criteria are determined via user stories. The testers/developers specify requirements with formal specifications based on programs properties, predicates, invariants, and constraints. The results show that the proposed tool generated effective and accurate test cases, test input. Meanwhile, expected output was also generated in a unified fashion from the user stories to meet acceptance criteria. The proposed solution also reduced the development time to identify test data as compared to manual Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) methodologies. This tool can support the developers to get a better idea about the required tests and able to translate the customer's natural languages to computer languages as well.

The value of performing TDD with Java, one of the longest established programming languages, is to improve the productivity of programmers and the maintainability and performance of code, and develop a deeper understanding of the language and how to employ it effectively. Starting with the basics of TDD and understanding why its adoption is beneficial, this book will take you from the first steps of TDD with Java until you are confident enough to embrace the practice in your day-to-day routine. You'll be guided through setting up tools, frameworks, and the environment you need, and we will dive right into hands-on exercises with the goal of mastering one practice, tool, or framework at a time. You'll learn about the Red-Green-Refactor procedure, how to write unit tests, and how to use them as executable documentation. With this book, you'll also discover how to design simple and easily maintainable code, work with mocks, utilize behavior-driven development, refactor old legacy code, and release a half-finished feature to production with feature toggles. You will finish this book with a deep understanding of the test-driven development methodology and the confidence to apply it to application programming with Java. What you will learn Explore the tools and frameworks required for effective TDD development Perform the Red-Green-Refactor process efficiently, the pillar around which all other TDD procedures are based Master effective unit testing in isolation from the rest of your code Design simple and easily maintainable code by implementing different techniques Use mocking frameworks and techniques to easily write and quickly execute tests Develop an application to implement behavior-driven development in conjunction with unit testing Enable and disable features using feature toggles Who This Book Is ForIf you're an experienced Java developer and want to implement more effective methods of programming systems and applications, then this book is for you.

Effective communication has always been a challenge between clients, business stakeholders, project managers, developers, testers and business analysts because a ""ubiquitous"" language that every one can easily understand and use does not exist. Specification By Example serves as that ubiquitous language for all, helps build right software that matters through effective communication. Specifications are written in plain English language using the Gherkin syntax to describe various behaviors of software.

267	Behave	The Business Transformation Framework and Enterprise Architecture Framework for Managers in Business Innovation: An Applied Holistic Mathematical Model	This journal article proposes a cross-business domain applied holistic mathematical model (AHMM) that is the result of a lifetime long research on business transformations, applied mathematics, software modelling, business engineering, financial analysis, and global enterprise architecture. This ultimate research is based on an authentic and proprietary mixed research method that is supported by an underlining mainly qualitative holistic reasoning model module. The proposed AHMM formalism attempts to mimic some functions of the human brain, which uses empirical processes that are mainly based on the beam-search, like heuristic decision-making process. The AHMM can be used to implement a decision-making system or an expert system that can integrate in the enterprise’s business, information and communication technology environments. The AHMM uses a behaviour driven development environment or a natural language environment that can be easily adopted by the project’s development teams. The AHMM offers a high level implementation environment that can be used by any team member without any prior computer sciences qualification. The AHMM can be used also to model enterprise architecture (EA) blueprints, business transformation projects, or knowledge management systems; it is supported by many real-life cases of various business domains. The uniqueness of this research is that the AHMM promotes a holistic unbundling process, the alignment of various EA standards and transformation strategies to support business transformation projects. © 2021 IGI Global.

Despite this, it was perceived by some to be evolving slowing and to have shortcomings for scripting, rapid prototyping and when trying to write minimalistic code. Other languages seemed to be innovating faster than Java and, while overcoming some of Java's shortcomings, used syntax that was less familiar to Java developers. Integration with Java libraries was also non-optimal.

The tool will also generate wireframe classes implementing pre and post-conditions within the code and using runtime contract analysis to generate information when an exception occurs, thereby helping to automate verification of bug fixes. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

271	Behave	Transit use and the work commute: Analyzing the role of last mile issues	This paper examines the role that public transport last mile problems play in mode choice decisions of commuters, while controlling for trip, built environment, and decision maker related variables. Last-mile problems arise due to lack of adequate connectivity between transit stops and trip origin or termination points. The paper is motivated by previous literature which has pointed out that high-quality public transit needs to consider end-to-end connectivity from trip origins to destinations. In contrast to previous work on transit last mile problems, which has focused on physical distance and sidewalks to transit stops, we consider a wider range of area factors including transit availability, job accessibility, parking costs, the quality of the pedestrian environment and risks to pedestrians from vehicular traffic, and social characteristics such as street-level crime. Using a discrete choice model, our goal is to unpack ways in which such factors contribute to the last-mile problem in home-based work trips, while controlling for these wider range of factors as well as the usual variables such as cost and trip time that inform mode choice. We find that the prevalence of non-domestic violent crimes reduces the odds of using all types of non-motorized alternatives as well as transit that is accessed either by walking or driving. Using compensating variation to measure welfare changes, we show that there are significant benefits that could be brought to transit service users through increasing safety in the transit access trip. By separately controlling for origin and destination transit accessibility, we show that improved destination accessibility significantly boosts transit use to a greater degree than increases in origin level accessibility. These findings argue for improving accessibility and related job densities at employment centers.

272	Behave	Extending behavior-driven development for assessing user interface design artifacts	This paper presents a scenario-based approach to specify requirements and tests by extending Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with the aim of ensuring the consistency between user requirements and user interface design artifacts. The approach has been evaluated by exploiting user requirements specified by a group of potential Product Owners (POs) for a web system to book business trips. Such requirements gave rise to a set of User Stories that have been refined and used to automatically check the consistency of task models, user interface (UI) prototypes, and final UIs of the system. The results have shown our approach was able to identify different types of inconsistencies in the set of analyzed artifacts and consistently keep the semantic traces between them. © 2019 Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.

279	Behave	An Approach for Guiding Developers in the Choice of Security Solutions and in the Generation of Concrete Test Cases	This paper tackles the problems of choosing security solutions and writing concrete security test cases for software, which are two tasks of the software life cycle requiring time, expertise and experience. We propose in this paper a method, based upon the notion of knowledge base, for helping developers devise more secure applications from the threat modelling step up to the testing one. The first stage of the approach consists of the acquisition and integration of publicly available security data into a data store. This one is used to assist developers in the design of attack-defense trees expressing the attacker possibilities to compromise an application and the defenses that may be implemented. These defenses are given under the form of security pattern combinations, a security pattern being a generic and reusable solution to design more secure applications. In the second stage, these trees are used to guide developers in the test case generation. Test verdicts show whether an application is vulnerable to the threats modelled by an ADTree and whether the consequences of the chosen security patterns are observed from the application (a consequence leading to some observable events partly showing that a pattern is correctly implemented). We applied this approach to web applications and evaluated it on 24 participants. The results are very encouraging in terms of the two criteria: comprehensibility and effectiveness.

281	Behave	Tit for tat and big steps: The case of Swedish banks’ internationalization 1961–2010	This study examines four major Swedish banks’ internationalization process patterns during the period 1961–2010. The study complements earlier studies by also considering the banks’ levels of market commitment. One objective is to determine if ‘Tit for tat’-behaviour seen in earlier studies of Swedish banks still prevails after the deregulation. Adding to earlier studies, this study also considers the level of market activities and commitments. A secondary purpose is to examine how the financial crisis has affected the banks with reference to the banks’ internationalization patterns. The empirical study is based on archival data on the studied banks’ foreign operations. The results show that the banks’ behaviour follows ‘Tit for tat’-behaviour but that the internationalization has accelerated after the deregulation, hence being carried out with ‘big steps’ rather than small steps. The analysis also shows that the mimetic behaviour is complemented by other types of internationalization behaviours. The differences in bank internationalization also mean that the effect of a financial crisis varies depending on how the banks have internationalized.

282	Behave	A case study of agile software development for safety-Critical systems projects	This study explores the introduction of agile software development within an avionics company engaged in safety-critical system engineering. There is increasing pressure throughout the software industry for development efforts to adopt agile software development in order to respond more rapidly to changing requirements and make more frequent deliveries of systems to customers for review and integration. This pressure is also being experienced in safety-critical industries, where release cycles on typically large and complex systems may run to several years on projects spanning decades. However, safety-critical system developments are normally highly regulated, which may constrain the adoption of agile software development or require adaptation of selected methods or practices. To investigate this potential conflict, we conducted a series of interviews with practitioners in the company, exploring their experiences of adopting agile software development and the challenges encountered. The study also explores the opportunities for altering the existing software process in the company to better fit agile software development to the constraints of software development for safety-critical systems. We conclude by identifying immediate future research directions to better align the tempo of software development for safety-critical systems and agile software development.

An empirical study of the impact of co-workers and the Confucian work ethic on deviance behavior	This study seeks to determine the impact of IT co-workers on individual deviance behavior in organizations. Using data collected from 322 IT employees and their supervisors in Chinese software companies, we also examine the impact of the Confucian work ethic on deviant behavior. The results suggest that both co-workers’ production deviance and the Confucian work ethic have impacts on individuals’ production deviance. The influence of IT co-workers’ production deviance was greater in high team climates and low team climates than in neutral team climates. The Confucian work ethic has no significant influence on production deviance in low team climates.

284	Behave	Legislation-driven development of a Gift Aid system using Event-B	This work presents our approach to formally model the Swiftaid system design, a digital platform that enables donors to automatically add Gift Aid to donations made via card payments. Following principles of Behaviour-Driven Development, we use Gherkin to capture requirements specified in legislation, specifically the UK Charity (Gift Aid Declarations) Regulations 2016. The Gherkin scenarios provide a basis for subsequent formal modelling and analysis using Event-B, Rodin and ProB. Interactive model simulations assist communication between domain experts, software architects and other stakeholders during requirements capture and system design, enabling the emergent system behaviour to be validated. Our approach was employed within the development of the real Swiftaid product, launched by Streeva in February 2019. Our analysis helped conclude that there was not a strong enough business case for one of the features, whichwas shown to provide nominal user convenience at the expense of increased complexity. This work provides a case study in allying formal and agile software development to enable rapid development of robust software.

285	Behave	Test Descriptions with ETSI TDL	To address the need for abstract, high-level test descriptions that can be shared among different stakeholders, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) commissioned the design of the Test Description Language (TDL). TDL is designed as a domain-specific language for testing, consisting of a standardised abstract syntax (meta-model) and concrete syntaxes for textual specification, graphical design, and model exchange between tools. Its main purpose is to support a test methodology that is followed in the standardisation work for software-intense systems at ETSI and is applicable in industrial projects as well. TDL enables the formal specification of both test objectives derived from system requirements and test descriptions refining the test objectives. The latter serve as blueprint for the implementation of executable tests. A standardised mapping of TDL specifications to test scripts in the standardised test execution language TTCN-3 widens the reach of TDL to ensure compatibility and consistency of generated executable tests. An open-source toolset has been developed as a common platform to accelerate the adoption of TDL and lower the barrier to entry for users and tool vendors. Reports from pilot applications within three ETSI standardisation groups demonstrate the practicality of the chosen approach.

286	Behave	Enabling IoT Platform Interoperability Using a Systematic Development Approach by Example	Today, the IoT landscape consists of a large number of vertical IoT platforms that are rarely interconnected. To enable creation of applications across platforms and domain boundaries interoperability needs to be established between IoT platforms. In this paper we present how this task can be simplified by utilizing a systematic software development process based on behavior- and domain-driven development. This process is illustrated using an example that uses the open source IoT interoperability framework symbIoTe to connect two indoor navigation platforms. We show that developers can actually profit from this approach but existing IoT interoperability frameworks are still cumbersome to use.

287	Behave	Mining reading patterns from eye-tracking data: method and demonstration	Understanding how developers interact with different software artifacts when performing comprehension tasks has a potential to improve developers’ productivity. In this paper, we propose a method to analyze eye-tracking data using process mining to find distinct reading patterns of how developers interacted with the different artifacts. To validate our approach, we conducted an exploratory study using eye-tracking involving 11 participants. We applied our method to investigate how developers interact with different artifacts during domain and code understanding tasks. To contextualize the reading patterns and to better understand the perceived benefits and challenges participants associated with the different artifacts and their choice of reading patterns, we complemented the eye-tracking data with the data obtained from think aloud. The study used behavior-driven development, a development practice that is increasingly used in Agile software development contexts, as a setting. The study shows that our method can be used to explore developers’ behavior at an aggregated level and identify behavioral patterns at varying levels of granularity. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

289	Behave	User interface prototype generation from agile requirements specifications written in concordia	User interface prototypes (UIP) are widely used to get feedback before building a software feature. They can prevent misunderstandings between the software development team and other stakeholders (e.g., users, investors) that lead to rework or a resulting software that does not meet their needs. UIP can also be a valuable resource in Agile software development, in which feedback is key. In this paper, we present an approach to generate UIP automatically from Agile requirements specifications written in Concordia and its corresponding prototype tool. The tool is able to generate UIP for web-based applications. We evaluated the approach and the tool with questionnaires, and the results revealed that: (i) the generated UIP are very similar to those drawn by respondents; (ii) the generated source code has good enough quality to be reused by developers; and (iii) they save design and development time.	agile; concordia; generation; user interface; user story	Thiago Delgado Pinto; Willian Inacio Goncalves; Pablo Veiga Costa	WebMedia '19: Proceedings of the 25th Brazillian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web	https://doi.org/10.1145/3323503.3360639		61-64		Included	Included	new_screen			2	ACM		User Interface Prototype Generation from Agile Requirements Specifications Written in Concordia		Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
290	Behave	Remote but Connected: Ownership-Inspired Behavior-Driven Development and What an E-Learning Governance System for Africa Could Look like	Using e-learning technology is one key for developing sustainable education in urban and remote areas in Western Africa as it reduced the demands on students who are well integrated in their rural society to leave their homes for an expensive education. In this chapter we present Ownership-inspired Behavior-Driven Development (OIBBD), a development strategy designed for e-learning governance in remote areas in Africa to support sustainable education as part of the agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and show how the design of a User Experience (UX), which is based on user-centered design and feedback from the African target group can be used to support the implementation of e-learning in Africa. We reflect on how a governance for sustainable development in theological education on the African continent can look like. We ask how such an e-learning governance can support remote e-learning in hard to reach areas in Africa and how this can be designed specifically of the needs of the African socio-culture. The guiding hypothesis of this chapter is, that especially leadership and its activation in African teachers can trigger them to develop ownership in using e-learning technology and this way supports the reaching of SDG 4, which deals with sustainable education. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.

291	Behave	Approach of integrating behaviour-driven development with hardware/software codesign	Using typical approaches in designing embedded systems to manage the specification and design of the hardware and software is not suitable in today’s projects. In this paper, we propose a model-driven approach to integrate Hardware/Software codesign with Behaviour-Driven Development. Hardware/Software codesign approach allows the hardware and the software to be designed and implemented concurrently and optimizes the project design constraint, such as performance and cost. Behaviour-Driven Development spurs project stakeholders to collaborate to ensure the right software is developed to meet their needs and ensures that all project participants communicate in the same language. The approach exploits the advantages of each approach and provides the ability to describe the behaviour of the software as executable user stories in a Hardware/Software codesign environment. The approach is evaluated using a renewable energy project in collaboration with a private company in Canada to build a system for autonomous load management of self-forming renewable energy nanogrids. © 2019, ICIC International.

Based on software engineering test methods, we present in this chapter a new approach, which integrates Agile test methods in the process of the simulation in order to design and test DEVS models. We propose an implementation in Python language based on the use of aspect programming concepts (patch, mocking objects, and decorators). This implementation is performed in the framework of the DEVSimPy environment with the definition of a plug-in dedicated to the automatic generation and execution of test scenario.

294	Behave	Gherkin Syntax Extension for Parameterization of Network Switch Configurations in Test Specification	We applied test automation in the style of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), an agile software development technique. In applying BDD, the problem is that a large amount of similar configurations of network switches have to be written in the BDD test specification files. To solve this problem, parameterization of configurations is considered effective. However, Gherkin, the BDD test specification language, does not provide syntax for parameterization. In this paper, we propose a syntax extension of Gherkin, which enables parameterization of configurations. From experiments on 11 configurations, parameterization using the proposed syntax extension can reduce the number of the lines used to describe configurations by 39%.	test specification;parameterization;BDD;Gherkin;syntax extension;network switch;configuration	Tianyao Li; Shigeru Tsubota; Koji Hirono	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops (ISSREW)	https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSREW.2017.30	1.

295	Behave	Automation and consistency analysis of test cases written in natural language: An industrial context	We present here a novel test automation strategy that receives as input a freestyle natural language (NL) test case (consisting of a sequence of test steps) and produces executable test scripts. This strategy relies on a database of previously automated seed test steps, available for reuse. New steps are automated via a capturing process by a tester, without requiring any programming knowledge. Automated tests can be executed by a replay facility. We discuss the reuse improvement, implementation effort, and user feedback regarding the industrial applicability and usability of our capture & replay tool. We then show that restricting the input textual description to obey a proposed Controlled NL (CNL) brings significant advantages: (1) reuse improvement; (2) the possibility of integration with a test generation framework; and (3) definition of consistency notions for test actions and test action sequences, that ensure, respectively, well-formedness of each action and a proper configuration to safely execute a sequence of actions. We formalize these consistency notions in Alloy and use the Alloy Analyzer to carry out the consistency check; the scalability of the analysis is assessed via an evaluation considering a repository with real test cases; the practical context of our work is mobile device testing, involving a partnership with Motorola Mobility, a Lenovo company.

296	Behave	Automatic acceptance testing of the web application security with ITU-T X.805 framework	Web application development companies should ensure the high quality of their products. This can be achieved through high quality of the software development lifecycle. Web applications are mostly running on the Internet and are being exposed to many security threats and malicious operations. The mission of EUCISE2020 project (EUropean test bed for the maritime Common Information Sharing Environment in the 2020 perspective) is to enhance interoperability between systems and networks. The interconnections must be established in a decentralized way using cutting-edge technologies. Hence, it requires innovative and practical solutions from the web development companies. The research problem is being addressed with the Stanford Research Institute NABC (Needs, Approach, Benefits and Competition) method. Our approach is to conceptualize a testing scenario for the web application development process. The concept utilizes the International Telecommunication Union recommended standard security framework (ITU-T X.805) in the context of test automation for end-to-end communications. This study presents a new holistic solution in feature driven fashion. As a result, we propose that building acceptance test scenarios using ITU-T X.805 guidelines in Software Development Lifecycle is a sustainable approach.

297	Behave	Testing of Web Services Using Behavior-Driven Development	Web services are commonly used in the communication of software over the web. To fully trust a web service, it should be tested and certified, but testing of web services provoke new challenges. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) can be applied to the testing of web services. Gherkin language is used to define scenarios in BDD. We used Gherkin language to define test cases for web services and we developed a tool to convert these test cases into JMeter test scripts.

298	Behave	ScrumOntoBDD: Agile software development based on scrum, ontologies and behaviour-driven development	When developing a Learning Management System (LMS) using Scrum, we noticed that it was quite often necessary to redefine some system behaviour scenarios, due to ambiguities in the requirement specifications, or due to misinterpretations of stories reported by the Product Owners (POs). The definition of test suites was also cumbersome, resulting in test suites that were incomplete or did not at all comply with the system requirements. Based on this experience and to deal with these problems, in this paper, we propose the ScrumOntoBDD approach to agile software development, which combines Scrum, ontologies and Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD). This approach is centred on the concepts and techniques of Scrum and BDD and focuses on the planning and analysis phases of the software life cycle, since the BDD tools currently provide little support to these phases, while most of the problems during the LMS development were found exactly there. We claim that our approach improves the software development practices in this respect. Furthermore, ScrumOntoBDD employs ontologies in order to reduce ambiguities intrinsic to the use of a natural language as a BDD ubiquitous language. In this paper, we illustrate and systematically evaluate our approach, showing that it is beneficial since it improves the communication between members of an agile development team. © 2021, The Author(s).

299	Behave	Formal Model Validation Through Acceptance Tests	When formal systems modelling is used as part of the development process, modellers need to understand the requirements in order to create appropriate models, and domain experts need to validate the final models to ensure they fit the needs of stakeholders. A suitable mechanism for such a validation are acceptance tests. In this paper we discuss how the principles of Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) can be applied to (i) formal modelling and (ii) validation of behaviour specifications, thus coupling those two tasks. We show how to close the gap between the informal domain specification and the formal model, thus enabling the domain expert to write acceptance tests in a high-level language matching the formal specification. We analyse the applicability of this approach by providing the Gherkin scenarios for an formal model of a ‘fixed virtual block’ approach to train movement control, developed according to the Hybrid ERTMS/ETCS Level 3 principles specified by the EEIG ERTMS Users Group and presented as a case study on the 6.

300	Behave	Executable requirements in a safety-critical context with Ada	When people who need the software and people who build the software do not understand each other, the success of a project may be impacted. In the same way, when it is difficult to know which test case corresponds to a given requirement, or if each and every requirement is fully covered by the test suite, we have a traceability issue that may also impact the success of the project. During the last few years, the agile community has suggested a new development paradigm in order to address this traceability issue. This approach is called Behaviour Driven Development (BDD). It is based on a new way of expressing requirements using a common language understandable by all parties at stake. After having described the Behaviour Driven Development in details, we introduce the XReq tool, an Open Source project developed by SOGILIS and part of the Open-DO project. It is designed to bring the Behaviour Driven Development to the Ada language and other statically typed languages. It also aims at facilitating the traceability of High and Low Level Tests in the context of DO-178B projects.		Bâillon C., Bouchez-Mongardé S.

301	Behave	Creation of multiple conceptual models from user stories – a natural language processing approach	While Agile methodologies are used in software development, researchers have identified many issues related to requirements engineering in Agile approaches. Some of these issues relate to ambiguity in user stories, which is a widely-used requirements specification mechanism in Agile methodologies. This research proposes the use of conceptual models while developing user stories. We posit that the use of conceptual models helps reducing ambiguity in user stories. An important aspect of our research is the creation of an algorithm for automatic generation of such models while developing the user stories. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

302	Behave	Test Automation with the Gauge Framework: Experience and Best Practices	While Behavior-driven development (BDD) tools such as Cucumber are powerful tools for automated testing, they have certain limitations. For example, they often enforce strict syntax for test cases, like the “Given-When-Then” format, which may not always be easy to write for a given test case. A new test automation framework named Gauge (gauge.org) addresses that limitation since it does not prescribe the BDD testing process with a strict syntax. In Gauge, writing a test case is as easy as writing down the flow of test cases in several itemized sentences in a natural language, like English. In the context of Testinium (testinium.com), a large software testing company which provides software testing services, tools and solutions to a large number of clients, we have actively used the Gauge framework since 2018 to develop large automated front-end test suites for several large web applications. In this paper/talk, the speakers will share several examples and best practices of developing automated tests in natural-language requirements using the Gauge framework. By learning from the ideas presented in the talk, readers (attendees) will be able to consider applying the Gauge framework in their own test automation projects. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

304	Behave	FormTester:effective integration of model-based and manually specified test cases	Whilst Model Based Testing (MBT) is an improvement over manual test specification, the leap from it to MBT can be hard. Only recently MBT tools for web applications have emerged that can recover models from existing manually specified test cases. However, there are further requirements for supporting both MBT and manually specified tests. First, we need support for the generation of test initialization procedures. Also, we want to identify areas of the system that are not testable due to defects. We present FormTester, a new MBT tool addressing these limitations. An evaluation with real web applications shows that FormTester helps to reduce the time spent on developing test cases.

306	Behave	ATDD by Example: A Practical Guide to Acceptance Test-Driven Development	With Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD), business customers, testers, and developers can collaborate to produce testable requirements that help them build higher quality software more rapidly. However, ATDD is still widely misunderstood by many practitioners. ATDD by Example is the first practical, entry-level, hands-on guide to implementing and successfully applying it. ATDD pioneer Markus Grtner walks readers step by step through deriving the right systems from business users, and then implementing fully automated, functional tests that accurately reflect business requirements, are intelligible to stakeholders, and promote more effective development. Through two end-to-end case studies, Grtner demonstrates how ATDD can be applied using diverse frameworks and languages. Each case study is accompanied by an extensive set of artifacts, including test automation classes, step definitions, and full sample implementations. These realistic examples illuminate ATDDs fundamental principles, show how ATDD fits into the broader development process, highlight tips from Grtners extensive experience, and identify crucial pitfalls to avoid. Readers will learn to Master the thought processes associated with successful ATDD implementationUse ATDD with Cucumber to describe software in ways businesspeople can understand Test web pages using ATDD toolsBring ATDD to Java with the FitNesse wiki-based acceptance test framework Use examples more effectively in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)Specify software collaboratively through innovative workshopsImplement more user-friendly and collaborative test automationTest more cleanly, listen to test results, and refactor tests for greater value If youre a tester, analyst, developer, or project manager, this book offers a concrete foundation for achieving real benefits with ATDD nowand it will help you reap even more value as you gain experience.

307	Behave	A serious gaming framework for decision support on hydrological hazards	With increasing population and human intervention on the natural environment, hazards are a growing threat, coming in many forms, including floods, droughts, soil erosion, and water pollution. A key approach to mitigate hydrological disaster risk at the community level is informed planning with decision support systems. The literature shows emerging efforts on multi-hazard decision support systems for hydrological disasters and demonstrates the need for an engaging, accessible, and collaborative serious game environment facilitating the relationship between the environment and communities. In this study, a web-based decision support tool (DST) was developed for hydrological multi-hazard analysis while employing gamification techniques to introduce a competitive element. The serious gaming environment provides functionalities for intuitive management, visualization, and analysis of geospatial, hydrological, and economic data to help stakeholders in the decision-making process regarding hydrological hazard preparedness and response. Major contributions of the presented DST include involving the community in environmental decision making by reducing the technical complexity required for analysis, increasing community awareness for the environmental and socio-economic consequences of hydrological hazards, and allowing stakeholders to discover and discuss potential trade-offs to hazardous scenarios considering the limitations in budget, regulations, and technicality. The paper describes the software design approaches and system architecture applied for a modular, secure, and scalable software as well as the framework's intuitive web-based user interfaces for real-time and collaborative data analysis and damage assessment. Finally, a case study was conducted to demonstrate the usability of DST in a formal setting and to measure user satisfaction with surveys.

308	Behave	Towards accountability driven development for machine learning systems	With rapid deployment of Machine Learning (ML) systems into diverse domains such as healthcare and autonomous driving, important questions regarding accountability in case of incidents resulting from ML errors remain largely unsolved. To improve accountability of ML systems, we introduce a framework called Accountability Driven Development (ADD). Our framework reuses Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) approach to describe testing scenarios and system behaviours in ML Systems’ development using natural language, guides and forces developers and intended users to actively record necessary accountability information in the design and implementation stages. In this paper, we illustrate how to transform accountability requirements to specific scenarios and provide syntax to describe them. The use of natural language allows non technical collaborators such as stakeholders and non ML domain experts deeply engaged in ML system development to provide more comprehensive evidence to support system’s accountability. This framework also attributes the responsibility to the whole project team including the intended users rather than putting all the accountability burden on ML engineers only. Moreover, this framework can be considered as a combination of both system test and acceptance test, thus making the development more efficient. We hope this work can attract more engineers to use our idea, which enables them to create more accountable ML systems. Copyright © 2021 for this paper by its authors.

309	Behave	Automated acceptance test refactoring	With the increasing popularity of agile software development and Test-Driven-Development, also maintenance of acceptance test has become an important issue. In this paper, we describe a concept and a tool for automated acceptance test maintenance using a refactoring approach. Acceptance tests are user tests which are used to determine if a system satisfies acceptance criteria and to enable a customer to determine whether or not to accept the system. In agile development acceptance test are also used as a mean for specification, i.e. acceptance tests are written in advance to the production code (called Behavior-Driven-Development - BDD). In an agile project this poses three major challenges with respect to maintenance of acceptance tests: new requirements may cause changes in the acceptance criteria, which require the system under test to be adapted; when the system under test undergoes a major restructuring, even the acceptance test might have to be adapted; with the increasing acceptance test suite in an agile project the tests themselves may undergo a major reorganization. Having a large acceptance test base, doing these refactorings manually is error prone and causes a lot of effort. In this paper we present a concept and tool for executing automated refactoring for Fit acceptance tests, which significantly reduces the effort for test maintenance and makes them much less error prone.	acceptance test; automation; eclipse; maintenance; plug-in; refactoring	Rodrick Borg; Martin Kropp	WRT '11: Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Refactoring Tools	https://doi.org/10.1145/1984732.1984736		15-21		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen			2	ACM		Automated Acceptance Test Refactoring	https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1984732.1984736	Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex

342	Behave	An Empirical Study of Agile Testing in A Distributed Software Development Project	The software engineering industry has witnessed an increasing number of innovative methods and practices in the last decade at different levels, ranging from development processes to software projects and from testing to verification software products. Extensive studies have been conducted empirically to investigate and discuss the impact of using agile principles in the testing process on distributed teams across geographical boundaries. This empirical study has a similar focus, using a real case study in a distributed domain and applying agile testing to a selected team, compares their outcome with another three teams to determine the impact of involving a client in a testing process to overcome distributed development challenges. The findings indicate a highly positive impact on team productivity when using agile tests as compared with other groups using central distributed team testing. All teams met a 90% testing requirement. However, the group applying agile testing verified more than 99% of all requests entered into the testing process, a notable difference supporting the productivity of any development project.

Among these frameworks, the most popular one is ANGULARJS, which is supported by Google. In spite of its popularity, there is not a clear knowledge on how ANGULARJS design and features affect the development experience of Web applications. Therefore, this paper reports the results of a survey about ANGULARJS, including answers from 460 developers. Our contributions include the identification of the most appreciated features of ANGULARJS (e.g., custom interface components, dependency injection, and two-way data binding) and the most problematic aspects of the framework (e.g., performance and implementation of directives).

361	Behave	From logistics process models to automated integration testing:proof-of-concept using open-source simulation software	This paper explores the practical integration of simulation methods into software development processes. An automated integration testing approach is presented, which enables continuous virtual commissioning. For this purpose, an analysis of the current state of knowledge and the standards of software development is presented. This is followed by a case study on logistics order management, referring to a typical B2B application in the retail logistics sector. The proof-of-concept shows how the usage of a simulation model for automated integration testing and its inclusion into continuous-integration can help to ensure software quality, particularly for process-centered logistics applications. The implemented setup proves the feasibility of the approach, using standard open-source development tools, and a Python-based open-source simulation library.

Unfortunately, real networks cannot be assumed to be fault-free, especially when considering various hardware problems, performance issues, or malicious attacks. Testing networked systems should therefore include evaluating fault tolerance under various network conditions.

365	Behave	A Behavior-driven Development and Reinforcement Learning approach for videogame automated testing	Video game development has undergone a significant transformation in the last decade, with modern games becoming increasingly complex and sophisticated. Testing these games for quality assurance is challenging and time-consuming, often relying on manual testers. In this paper, we introduce an automated testing approach that combines Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to streamline the testing process. We present a framework that uses natural language-based test cases to describe game behaviors and expected outcomes, combined with RL, to test games automatically. We validated our approach through tests on four distinct Python-based games. We analyzed the impact of game complexity on training duration and discussed the challenges of defining optimal reward functions. Our framework provides a structured approach to address RL complexities, simplifying the process of creating test scenarios. Combining BDD and RL offers a promising solution to test complex modern video games more efficiently and ensure higher game quality upon release.	videogame; testing; reinforcement learning; behavior-driven development; software quality; software engineering	Vincent Mastain; Fabio Petrillo	GAS '24: Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 8th International Workshop on Games and Software Engineering	https://doi.org/10.1145/3643658.3643919		1-8		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen			2	ACM		Behavior-Driven Development		Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

The approach relies on a textual domain-specific language (DSL) to allow end users to specify the expected robot behaviour through Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) scenarios. To evaluate the feasibility of our approach, we conducted a workshop with a physical therapist who was tasked with programming two different routines for a training robot. Results of the study highlighted the cognitive strategies employed by the end user to solve the task and also the pain points which required higher efforts from the user and should be therefore prioritized in our future work.	behaviour-driven development (BDD); domain-specific languages (DSLs); end-user programming; robot programming	Jose Pablo De La Rosa; Thiago Rocha Silva; Anders Stengaard Sorensen	HRI '24: Companion of the 2024 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction	https://doi.org/10.1145/3610978.3640618		387-391		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen			2	ACM		Behaviour-Driven Development		Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

372	Behave	Transferring transactional business processes to FaaS	Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a modern cloud service model that has gained significant attention from the research and industry communities in recent years for its many benefits such as dynamic scaling, cost efficiency, faster programming, flexibility to microservices and containers technology. However, the building and deployment of serverless applications come with many challenges that need to be tackled, like workflow design complexity and migration of other applications. When transactions between different parties are involved, the workflow becomes knotty and the communication between participants and all properties of transactions have to be properly resolved. Transactions have widely been discussed in Business processes, so same practices might be adopted by serverless workflows. In this work we provide guidelines and mapping mechanisms for transforming transactional Business Process Modeling Notation 2.0 (BPMN2) applications to a serverless platform. We shed light on the current inability of function orchestrators to express workflow definitions, and deal with various architectural dilemmas that stem from the dissimilar nature of stateful BPMN vs. stateless serverless applications. We overcome the unbalanced capabilities between well-established BPMN notations and function orchestration definitions and illustrate how to exploit and combine cloud native services that comes with FaaS to create serverless applications.

In addition to light intensity, focusing and capture distance problems, percent of IRIS visibility are also one of the major problems. This can cause failure in most common method, Hamming Distance (HD), used for matching the templates. This paper proposes the iris code organization and searching algorithm suggesting the improvement in template matching process. The algorithm also suggests template selection to avoid comparison with all existing IRIS codes resulting in faster searching speed. For the IRIS that has accumulated the cataract, HD methods shows major failure results. The proposed algorithm shows better performance over conventional HD method of template matching and IRIS code selection for template matching.	iris code database; iris code searching; iris codes organization; iris comparison	P.

This is particularly challenging for tasks like software testing, which are already perceived as less enjoyable, prompting developers to seek distractions. To mitigate this, applying gamification to testing activities can enhance motivation for test writing. One such gamification tool is Gamekins, which integrates challenges, quests, achievements, and leaderboards into the Jenkins CI (continuous integration) platform. However, as Gamekins is typically accessed through a browser, it introduces a context switch. This paper presents anIntelliJ plugindesigned to seamlessly integrate Gamekins' gamification elements into the IDE, aiming to minimize context switches and boost developer motivation for test writing.	gamification; IDE; IntelliJ; software testing; continuous integration	Philipp Straubinger; Gordon Fraser	IDE '24: Proceedings of the 1st ACM/IEEE Workshop on Integrated Development Environments	https://doi.org/10.1145/3643796.3648462		91-94		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen			2	ACM		Continuous Integration		Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

391	Behave	Design and deployment considerations for high performance MIMO testbeds	MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) enabled systems are characterized by higher reliability and transmission rates, as compared to conventional SISO (Single Input Single Output) systems. However, unless administered properly, the MIMO technologymay notfacilitate very high throughputs on point-to-point wireless links. Therefore, it becomes imperative for the network architect to design such networks in ways that fully exploit the inherent properties of MIMO. In this paper, we first conduct an extensive experimental study, using a powerful hardware platform, in order to understand the behavior of MIMO links in different topological scenarios. Our experiments involve scenarios with MIMO links in isolation, as well as in competition with other MIMO and SISO links. Second, we perform measurements with different commercial platforms towards assessing the ability of each platform to efficiently support the MIMO technology. Based on our experimental observations we deduce that the CPU processing speed of the underlying hardware platform is an important factor that can hide the performance benefits of a MIMO enabled tranceiver. We comment on the applicability of the different hardware choices that we test; furthermore, we suggest the most appropriate choice for building a MIMO testbed, taking into account the cost, the extend-ability and the re-usability of the selected platform. Finally, having adopted this choice in our testbed design, we provide a description of our testbed architecture.

Its popularity and wide adoption make it an attractive target for attackers and a number of XML-based attack types have been reported recently. This raises the need for cost-effective, automated testing of web services to detect XML-related vulnerabilities, which is the focus of this paper. We discuss a taxonomy of the types of XML injection attacks and use it to derive four different ways to mutate XML messages, turning them into attacks (tests) automatically. Further, we consider domain constraints and attack grammars, and use a constraint solver to generate XML messages that are both malicious and valid, thus making it more difficult for any protection mechanism to recognise them. As a result, such messages have a better chance to detect vulnerabilities. Our evaluation on an industrial case study has shown that a large proportion (78.86%) of the attacks generated using our approach could circumvent the first layer of security protection, an XML gateway (firewall), a result that is much better than what a state-of-the-art tool based on fuzz testing could achieve.

412	Behave	The proposition of Process flow model for Scrum and eXtreme Programming	To carry out a quality project, the company collaborators need to rely on an efficient management methodology. It is the key to organize the project in a structured and streamlined manner, it helps the team to be more structured. The traditional methods are usually used on projects based on very precise ideas with very detailed specifications and planning which anticipated all possible risks. Nevertheless, these do not allow any kind of interaction with the customer, who will receive the project once it is finished. For that reason, solutions like eXtreme Programming and Scrum have been proposed by project management experts respecting the interaction with the customer, ability to change, and so on. These methods share the same values and principles, but each one has its own singularities. In this paper, we will present the process flow model of the Scrum and XP methods. For this process flow model, we used the BPMN models.

488	Behave	Program comprehension of domain-specific and general-purpose languages: replication of a family of experiments using integrated development environments	Domain-specific languages (DSLs) allow developers to write code at a higher level of abstraction compared with general-purpose languages (GPLs). Developers often use DSLs to reduce the complexity of GPLs. Our previous study found that developers performed program comprehension tasks more accurately and efficiently with DSLs than with corresponding APIs in GPLs. This study replicates our previous study to validate and extend the results when developers use IDEs to perform program comprehension tasks. We performed a dependent replication of a family of experiments. We made two specific changes to the original study: (1) participants used IDEs to perform the program comprehension tasks, to address a threat to validity in the original experiment and (2) each participant performed program comprehension tasks on either DSLs or GPLs, not both as in the original experiment. The results of the replication are consistent with and expanded the results of the original study. Developers are significantly more effective and efficient in tool-based program comprehension when using a DSL than when using a corresponding API in a GPL. The results indicate that, where a DSL is available, developers will perform program comprehension better using the DSL than when using the corresponding API in a GPL.
