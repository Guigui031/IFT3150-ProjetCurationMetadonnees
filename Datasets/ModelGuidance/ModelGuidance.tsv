812	ModelGuidance	Interacting process classes	Many reactive control systems consist of classes of active objects involving both intraclass interactions (i.e., objects belonging to the same class interacting with each other) and interclass interactions. Such reactive control systems appear in domains such as telecommunication, transportation and avionics. In this article, we propose a modeling and simulation technique for interacting process classes. Our modeling style uses standard notations to capture behavior. In particular, the control flow of a process class is captured by a labeled transition system, unit interactions between process objects are described as transactions, and the structural relations are captured via class diagrams. The key feature of our approach is that our execution semantics leads to an abstract simulation technique which involves (i) grouping together active objects into equivalence classes according their potential futures, and (ii) keeping track of the number of objects in an equivalence class rather than their identities. Our simulation strategy is both time and memory efficient and we demonstrate this on well-studied nontrivial examples of reactive systems. We also present a case study involving a weather-update controller from NASA to demonstrate the use of our simulator for debugging realistic designs.	message sequence charts;  active objects;  Unified Modeling Language (UML);  Abstract execution	Goel, Ankit; Roychoudhury, Abhik; Thiagarajan, P.

The key feature of our approach is that our execution semantics leads to an abstract simulation technique which involves (i) grouping together active objects into equivalence classes according their potential futures, and (ii) keeping track of the number of objects in an equivalence class rather than their identities. Our simulation strategy is both time and memory efficient and we demonstrate this on well-studied nontrivial examples of reactive systems. We also present a case study involving a weather-update controller from NASA to demonstrate the use of our simulator for debugging realistic designs."",

1511	ModelGuidance	Formal analysis of event-driven cyber physical systems	We propose a programming language (E#) that facilitates formal verification of security properties of event-driven cyberphysical systems. We describe the syntax of E# with the help of several illustrative examples. Since the environment plays a crucial role in cyberphysical systems, E# facilitates modeling of the environment processes abstractly using the novel 'causes' clauses. We show that event causality graphs (ECGs) may be constructed from causes clauses and handle specifications. We present how ECGs can be used to detect compute-bound event loops which are undesirable in event-driven systems and also to analyze response-style event liveness specifications. We show how safety properties can be inductively established by employing either theorem-proving or model checking. This technique facilitates compositional verification, allowing us to establish properties of each component separately. The technique also avoids state explosion that arises due to interleaving of the atomic blocks of concurrent event handlers. An interesting feature of our safety analysis is our use of model checking for safety properties in an inductive setting. We conclude that E# is a viable language for programming safety-critical event-driven cyberphysical systems.

1964	ModelGuidance	A precise style for business process modelling: results from two controlled experiments	We present a precise style for the modelling of business processes based on the UML activity diagrams and two controlled experiments to compare this style with a lighter variant. The comparison has been performed with respect to the comprehensibility of business processes and the effort to comprehend them. The first experiment has been conducted at the Free University of Bolzano-Bozen, while the second experiment (i.e., a differentiated replication) at the University of Genova. The participants to the first experiment were Master students and so more experienced than the participants to the replication, who were Bachelor students. The results indicate that: (a) all the participants achieved a significantly better comprehension level with the precise style; (b) the used style did not have any significant impact on the effort; and (c) more experienced participants benefited more from the precise style.

2620	ModelGuidance	Gamification in education: a mixed-methods study of gender on computer science students' academic performance and identity development	Underrepresentationofwomenincomputerscience(CS) increasingly demands the necessity to find and enhance current learning engagement approaches to bring more women into computing fields. Some researchers have been exploring the influenceofgamificationonfemalestudentsas oneofthese possible learning engagement strategies.Gamificationrefers to the introductionofvideo game elements into non-game activities to enhance engagement and motivation. Previous studies have reported mixed resultsofthe impactofgamificationonwomen.Inthisstudy, we introduce SEP-CyLE (Software Engineering and Programming Cyberlearning Environment), an online gamified tool that was designed to provide supplemental computing content tostudents. This paper presentsaconvergentmixed-methodsstudyguided by socialidentitytheory and self-efficacy to understand women's experiences with this gamified tool. More specifically, thisstudyexplores virtual points' and leaderboards' effectsonCSidentitydevelopment, self-efficacy, andperformance. The results show that virtual points and the leaderboard contributed to improvedperformanceforstudentsofall genders, suggesting thatgamificationisagender-neutral learning engagement strategy that improves femalestudents'performanceas much as malestudents. Regardlessofimprovedperformance, most women did not actively enjoy or were motivated by the virtual points or leaderboardinSEP-CyLE. Additionally,gamificationhad no significant impactonCSidentitydevelopmentor self-efficacy constructs and had little to no impactonwomen's interest and engagementinthe fieldofcomputing.

2944	ModelGuidance	Holistic Combination of Structural and Textual Code Information for Context Based API Recommendation	Context based API recommendation is an important way to help developers find the needed APIs effectively and efficiently. For effective API recommendation, we need not only a joint view of both structural and textual code information, but also a holistic view of correlated API usage in control and data flow graph as a whole. Unfortunately, existing API recommendation methods exploit structural or textual code information separately. In this work, we propose a novel API recommendation approach called APIRec-CST (API Recommendation by Combining Structural and Textual code information). APIRec-CST is a deep learning model that combines the API usage with the text information in the source code based on an API Context Graph Network and a Code Token Network that simultaneously learn structural and textual features for API recommendation. We apply APIRec-CST to train a model for JDK library based on 1,914 open-source Java projects and evaluate the accuracy and MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) of API recommendation with another 6 open-source projects. The results show that our approach achieves respectively a top-1, top-5, top-10 accuracy and MRR of 60.3, 81.5, 87.7 and 69.4 percent, and significantly outperforms an existing graph-based statistical approach and a tree-based deep learning approach for API recommendation. A further analysis shows that textual code information makes sense and improves the accuracy and MRR. The sensitivity analysis shows that the top-k accuracy and MRR of APIRec-CST are insensitive to the number of APIs to be recommended in a hole. We also conduct a user study in which two groups of students are asked to finish 6 programming tasks with or without our APIRec-CST plugin. The results show that APIRec-CST can help the students to finish the tasks faster and more accurately and the feedback on the usability is overwhelmingly positive. (c) 1976-2012 IEEE.

For effective API recommendation, we need not only a joint view of both structural and textual code information, but also a holistic view of correlated API usage in control and data flow graph as a whole. Unfortunately, existing API recommendation methods exploit structural or textual code information separately. In this work, we propose a novel API recommendation approach called APIRec-CST (API Recommendation by Combining Structural and Textual code information). APIRec-CST is a deep learning model that combines the API usage with the text information in the source code based on an API Context Graph Network and a Code Token Network that simultaneously learn structural and textual features for API recommendation. We apply APIRec-CST to train a model for JDK library based on 1,914 open-source Java projects and evaluate the accuracy and MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) of API recommendation with another 6 open-source projects. The results show that our approach achieves respectively a top-1, top-5, top-10 accuracy and MRR of 60.3, 81.5, 87.7 and 69.4 percent, and significantly outperforms an existing graph-based statistical approach and a tree-based deep learning approach for API recommendation. A further analysis shows that textual code information makes sense and improves the accuracy and MRR. The sensitivity analysis shows that the top-k accuracy and MRR of APIRec-CST are insensitive to the number of APIs to be recommended in a hole. We also conduct a user study in which two groups of students are asked to finish 6 programming tasks with or without our APIRec-CST plugin. The results show that APIRec-CST can help the students to finish the tasks faster and more accurately and the feedback on the usability is overwhelmingly positive. (c) 1976-2012 IEEE."",

3365	ModelGuidance	Improving model-based testing in automotive software engineering	Testing is crucial to successfully engineering reliable automotive software. The manual derivation of test cases from ambiguous textual requirements is costly and error-prone. Model-based development can reduce the test case derivation effort by capturing requirements in structured models from which test cases can be generated with reduced effort. To facilitate the automated test case derivation at BMW, we conducted an anonymous survey among its testing practitioners and conceived a model-based improvement of the testing activities. The new model-based test case derivation extends BMW's SMArDT method with automated generation of tests, which addresses many of the practitioners' challenges uncovered through our study. This ultimately can facilitate quality assurance for automotive software.	model-based testing;  test case creation	Kriebel, Stefan; Markthaler, Matthias; Salman, Karin Samira; Greifenberg, Timo; Hillemacher, Steffen; Rumpe, Bernhard; Schulze, Christoph; Wortmann, Andreas; Orth, Philipp; Richenhagen, Johannes	ICSE-SEIP '18: Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice	https://doi.org/10.1145/3183519.3183533		172-180	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3183519.3183533,

5044	ModelGuidance	An empirical study of software release notes	Release notes are an important source of information about a new software release. Such notes contain information regarding what is new, changed, and/or got fixed in a release. Despite the importance of release notes, they are rarely explored in the research literature. Little is known about the contained information, e.g., contents and structure, in release notes. To better understand the types of contained information in release notes, we manually analyzed 85 release notes across 15 different software systems. In our manual analysis, we identify six different types of information (e.g., caveats and addressed issues) that are contained in release notes. Addressed issues refer to new features, bugs, and improvements that were integrated in that particular release. We observe that most release notes list only a selected number of addressed issues (i.e., 6-26 \% of all addressed issues in a release). We investigated nine different factors (e.g., issue priority and type) to better understand the likelihood of an issue being listed in release notes. The investigation is conducted on eight release notes of three software systems using four machine learning techniques. Results show that certain factors, e.g., issue type, have higher influence on the likelihood of an issue to be listed in release notes. We use machine learning techniques to automatically suggest the issues to be listed in release notes. Our results show that issues listed in all release notes can be automatically determined with an average precision of 84 \% and an average recall of 90 \%. To train and build the classification models, we also explored three scenarios: (a) having the user label some issues for a release and automatically suggest the remaining issues for that particular release, (b) using the previous release notes for the same software system, and (c) using prior releases for the current software system and the rest of the studied software systems. Our results show that the content of release notes vary between software systems and across the versions of the same software system. Nevertheless, automated techniques can provide reasonable support to the writers of such notes with little training data. Our study provides developers with empirically-supported advice about release notes instead of simply relying on adhoc advice from on-line inquiries.

    abstract = ""Release notes are an important source of information about a new software release. Such notes contain information regarding what is new, changed, and/or got fixed in a release. Despite the importance of release notes, they are rarely explored in the research literature. Little is known about the contained information, e.g., contents and structure, in release notes. To better understand the types of contained information in release notes, we manually analyzed 85 release notes across 15 different software systems. In our manual analysis, we identify six different types of information (e.g., caveats and addressed issues) that are contained in release notes. Addressed issues refer to new features, bugs, and improvements that were integrated in that particular release. We observe that most release notes list only a selected number of addressed issues (i.e., 6-26 \\% of all addressed issues in a release). We investigated nine different factors (e.g., issue priority and type) to better understand the likelihood of an issue being listed in release notes. The investigation is conducted on eight release notes of three software systems using four machine learning techniques. Results show that certain factors, e.g., issue type, have higher influence on the likelihood of an issue to be listed in release notes. We use machine learning techniques to automatically suggest the issues to be listed in release notes. Our results show that issues listed in all release notes can be automatically determined with an average precision of 84 \\% and an average recall of 90 \\%. To train and build the classification models, we also explored three scenarios: (a) having the user label some issues for a release and automatically suggest the remaining issues for that particular release, (b) using the previous release notes for the same software system, and (c) using prior releases for the current software system and the rest of the studied software systems. Our results show that the content of release notes vary between software systems and across the versions of the same software system. Nevertheless, automated techniques can provide reasonable support to the writers of such notes with little training data. Our study provides developers with empirically-supported advice about release notes instead of simply relying on adhoc advice from on-line inquiries."",

6149	ModelGuidance	On the Engineering of IoT-Intensive Digital Twin Software Systems	Digital Twins (DT) are software systems representing different aspects of a physical or conceptual counterpart---the real twin, which is instrumented with several sensors or computing devices that generate, consume and transfer data to its DT with different purposes. In other words, DT systems are, to a large extent, IoT-intensive systems. Indeed, by exploiting and managing IoT data, artificial intelligence, and big data and simulation capabilities, DTs have emerged as a promising approach to manage the virtual manifestation of real-world entities throughout their entire lifecycle. Their proliferation will contribute to realizing the long-craved convergence of virtual and physical spaces to augment things and human capabilities. In this context, despite the proposal of noteworthy contributions, we argue that DTs have not been sufficiently investigated from a software engineering perspective. To address this, in this paper we propose GEMINIS, an architectural reference model that adopts self-adaptation, control, and model-driven engineering techniques to specify the structural and behavioural aspects of DTs and enable the evolution of their internal models. Moreover, we introduce an approach for engineering IoT-intensive Digital Twin Software Systems (DTSS) using GEMINIS' capabilities to deal with uncertain conditions that are inherent to the nature of mirrored physical environments and that might compromise the fidelity of a DT. With GEMINIS and the proposed approach, we aim to advance the engineering of DTSS as well as IoT and cyber-physical systems by providing practitioners with guidelines to model and specify inherent structural and behavioural characteristics of DTs, addressing common design concerns.

6165	ModelGuidance	Interactive cross-language code retrieval with auto-encoders	Cross-language code retrieval is necessary in many real-world scenarios. A major application is program translation, e.g., porting codebases from an obsolete or deprecated language to a modern one or re-implementing existing projects in one's preferred programming language. Existing approaches based on the translation model require large amounts of training data and extra information or neglects significant characteristics of programs. Leveraging cross-language code retrieval to assist automatic program translation can make use of Big Code. However, existing code retrieval systems have the barrier to finding the translation with only the features of the input program as the query. In this paper, we present BigPT for interactive cross-language retrieval from Big Code only based on raw code and reusing the retrieved code to assist program translation. We build on existing work on cross-language code representation and propose a novel predictive transformation model based on auto-encoders. The model is trained on Big Code to generate a target-language representation, which will be used as the query to retrieve the most relevant translations for a given program. Our query representation enables the user to easily update and correct the returned results to improve the retrieval process. Our experiments show that BigPT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of program accuracy. Using our novel querying and retrieving mechanism, BigPT can be scaled to the large dataset and efficiently retrieve the translation.

6170	ModelGuidance	User-centered performance engineering of model transformations	In Model-Driven Engineering, models are key artifacts. Due to the fact that the systems to be developed become larger and more complex, the corresponding models also become larger and more complex. This trend also influences operations on these models, such as transformations. They are applied at design time and at runtime, e.g. to update models, generate code or to create new models. With increasing model size, their execution time increases, making their performance an important quality aspect. Current research mainly concentrates on further improvements of the transformation engine that performs the transformation, but this will not solve the problem alone. Engine optimizations will never be able to mitigate every possible performance problem due to the fact that there's an arbitrary amount of ways to define a transformation as well as the models and meta-models that all affect the runtime. Therefore, transformation engineers must also ensure that they define their transformations in such a way that they have a short execution time. To achieve this, a performance engineering approach for model transformations is necessary. This approach must consist of steps and techniques that help to analyze and improve performance. In this paper we present our performance engineering approach for declarative model transformations. We identified the five artifacts Guidelines, Monitoring, Analyses, Visualizations and Improvement proposals that form our approach. These artifacts are intended to help an engineer to understand the execution of a transformation and the causes of performance problems with the help of Analyses and Visualizations based on our Monitoring in order to improve them. During the improvement the engineer will be supported by Guidelines and Improvement proposals.	performance engineering;  henshin;  declarative model transformation	Groner, Raffaela	MODELS '19: Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems	https://doi.org/10.1109/MODELS-C.2019.00097		635-641	"@inproceedings{10.1109/MODELS-C.2019.00097,

6172	ModelGuidance	Less training, more repairing please: revisiting automated program repair via zero-shot learning	Due to the promising future of Automated Program Repair (APR), researchers have proposed various APR techniques, including heuristic-based, template-based, and constraint-based techniques. Among such classic APR techniques, template-based techniques have been widely recognized as state of the art. However, such template-based techniques require predefined templates to perform repair, and their effectiveness is thus limited. To this end, researchers have leveraged the recent advances in Deep Learning to further improve APR. Such learning-based techniques typically view APR as a Neural Machine Translation problem, using the buggy/fixed code snippets as the source/target languages for translation. In this way, such techniques heavily rely on large numbers of high-quality bug-fixing commits, which can be extremely costly/challenging to construct and may limit their edit variety and context representation.

6199	ModelGuidance	Path-sensitive code embedding via contrastive learning for software vulnerability detection	Machine learning and its promising branch deep learning have shown success in a wide range of application domains. Recently, much effort has been expended on applying deep learning techniques (e.g., graph neural networks) to static vulnerability detection as an alternative to conventional bug detection methods. To obtain the structural information of code, current learning approaches typically abstract a program in the form of graphs (e.g., data-flow graphs, abstract syntax trees), and then train an underlying classification model based on the (sub)graphs of safe and vulnerable code fragments for vulnerability prediction. However, these models are still insufficient for precise bug detection, because the objective of these models is to produce classification results rather than comprehending the semantics of vulnerabilities, e.g., pinpoint bug triggering paths, which are essential for static bug detection.

6267	ModelGuidance	A Survey on Deep Learning for Software Engineering	"In 2006, Geoffrey Hinton proposed the concept of training ""Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)"" and an improved model training method to break the bottleneck of neural network development. More recently, the introduction of AlphaGo in 2016 demonstrated the powerful learning ability of deep learning and its enormous potential. Deep learning has been increasingly used to develop state-of-the-art software engineering (SE) research tools due to its ability to boost performance for various SE tasks. There are many factors, e.g., deep learning model selection, internal structure differences, and model optimization techniques, that may have an impact on the performance of DNNs applied in SE. Few works to date focus on summarizing, classifying, and analyzing the application of deep learning techniques in SE. To fill this gap, we performed a survey to analyze the relevant studies published since 2006. We first provide an example to illustrate how deep learning techniques are used in SE. We then conduct a background analysis (BA) of primary studies and present four research questions to describe the trend of DNNs used in SE (BA), summarize and classify different deep learning techniques (RQ1), and analyze the data processing including data collection, data classification, data pre-processing, and data representation (RQ2). In RQ3, we depicted a range of key research topics using DNNs and investigated the relationships between DL-based model adoption and multiple factors (i.e., DL architectures, task types, problem types, and data types). We also summarized commonly used datasets for different SE tasks. In RQ4, we summarized the widely used optimization algorithms and provided important evaluation metrics for different problem types, including regression, classification, recommendation, and generation. Based on our findings, we present a set of current challenges remaining to be investigated and outline a proposed research road map highlighting key opportunities for future work."

6311	ModelGuidance	Identifying algorithm in program code based on structural features using CNN classification model	In software, an algorithm is a well-organized sequence of actions that provides the optimal way to complete a task. Algorithmic thinking is also essential to break-down a problem and conceptualize solutions in some steps. The proper selection of an algorithm is pivotal to improve computational performance and software productivity as well as to programming learning. That is, determining a suitable algorithm from a given code is widely relevant in software engineering and programming education. However, both humans and machines find it difficult to identify algorithms from code without any meta-information. This study aims to propose a program code classification model that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify codes based on the algorithm. First, program codes are transformed into a sequence of structural features (SFs). Second, SFs are transformed into a one-hot binary matrix using several procedures. Third, different structures and hyperparameters of the CNN model are fine-tuned to identify the best model for the code classification task. To do so, 61,614 real-world program codes of different types of algorithms collected from an online judge system are used to train, validate, and evaluate the model. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed model can identify algorithms and classify program codes with a high percentage of accuracy. The average precision, recall, and F-measure scores of the best CNN model are 95.65%, 95.85%, and 95.70%, respectively, indicating that it outperforms other baseline models. (c) 2022, The Author(s).

6423	ModelGuidance	Adversarial Robustness of Deep Code Comment Generation	Deep neural networks (DNNs)have shown remarkable performance in a variety of domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Recently they also have been applied to various software engineering tasks, typically involving processing source code. DNNs are well-known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., fabricated inputs that could lead to various misbehaviors of the DNN model while being perceived as benign by humans. In this paper, we focus on the code comment generation task in software engineering and study the robustness issue of the DNNs when they are applied to this task. We proposeACCENT(Adversarial Code Comment gENeraTor), an identifier substitution approach to craft adversarial code snippets, which are syntactically correct andsemantically close tothe original code snippet, but may mislead the DNNs to produce completely irrelevant code comments. In order to improve the robustness,ACCENTalso incorporates a novel training method, which can be applied to existing code comment generation models. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate our approach by attacking the mainstream encoder-decoder architectures on two large-scale publicly available datasets. The results show thatACCENTefficiently produces stable attacks with functionality-preserving adversarial examples, and the generated examples have better transferability compared with the baselines. We also confirm, via experiments, the effectiveness in improving model robustness with our training method.

6467	ModelGuidance	Holistic Combination of Structural and Textual Code Information for Context Based API Recommendation	Context based API recommendation is an important way to help developers find the needed APIs effectively and efficiently. For effective API recommendation, we need not only a joint view of both structural and textual code information, but also a holistic view of correlated API usage in control and data flow graph as a whole. Unfortunately, existing API recommendation methods exploit structural or textual code information separately. In this work, we propose a novel API recommendation approach called APIRec-CST (API Recommendation by Combining Structural and Textual code information). APIRec-CST is a deep learning model that combines the API usage with the text information in the source code based on an API Context Graph Network and a Code Token Network that simultaneously learn structural and textual features for API recommendation. We apply APIRec-CST to train a model for JDK library based on 1,914 open-source Java projects and evaluate the accuracy and MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) of API recommendation with another 6 open-source projects. The results show that our approach achieves respectively a top-1, top-5, top-10 accuracy and MRR of 60.3, 81.5, 87.7 and 69.4 percent, and significantly outperforms an existing graph-based statistical approach and a tree-based deep learning approach for API recommendation. A further analysis shows that textual code information makes sense and improves the accuracy and MRR. The sensitivity analysis shows that the top-k accuracy and MRR of APIRec-CST are insensitive to the number of APIs to be recommended in a hole. We also conduct a user study in which two groups of students are asked to finish 6 programming tasks with or without our APIRec-CST plugin. The results show that APIRec-CST can help the students to finish the tasks faster and more accurately and the feedback on the usability is overwhelmingly positive. (c) 1976-2012 IEEE.

6470	ModelGuidance	Automatic detection of Long Method and God Class code smells through neural source code embeddings	Code smells are structures in code that often harm its quality. Manually detecting code smells is challenging, so researchers proposed many automatic detectors. Traditional code smell detectors employ metric-based heuristics, but researchers have recently adopted a Machine-Learning (ML) based approach. This paper compares the performance of multiple ML-based code smell detection models against multiple metric-based heuristics for detection of God Class and Long Method code smells. We assess the effectiveness of different source code representations for ML: we evaluate the effectiveness of traditionally used code metrics against code embeddings (code2vec, code2seq, and CuBERT). This study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-trained neural source code embeddings for code smell detection to the best of our knowledge. This approach helped us leverage the power of transfer learning - our study is the first to explore whether the knowledge mined from code understanding models can be transferred to code smell detection. A secondary contribution of our research is the systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of code smell detection approaches on the same large-scale, manually labeled MLCQ dataset. Almost every study that proposes a detection approach tests this approach on the dataset unique for the study. Consequently, we cannot directly compare the reported performances to derive the best-performing approach.

6498	ModelGuidance	On the Value of Oversampling for Deep Learning in Software Defect Prediction	One truism of deep learning is that the automatic feature engineering (seen in the first layers of those networks) excuses data scientists from performing tedious manual feature engineering prior to running DL. For the specific case of deep learning for defect prediction, we show that that truism is false. Specifically, when we pre-process data with a novel oversampling technique called fuzzy sampling, as part of a larger pipeline called GHOST (Goal-oriented Hyper-parameter Optimization for Scalable Training), then we can do significantly better than the prior DL state of the art in 14/20 defect data sets. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results significantly faster deep learners. These results present a cogent case for the use of oversampling prior to applying deep learning on software defect prediction datasets. (c) 1976-2012 IEEE.

6624	ModelGuidance	On the use of textual feature extraction techniques to support the automated detection of refactoring documentation	Refactoring is the art of improving the internal structure of a program without altering its external behavior, and it is an important task when it comes to software maintainability. While existing studies have focused on the detection of refactoring operations by mining software repositories, little was done to understand how developers document their refactoring activities. Therefore, there is recent trend trying to detect developers documentation of refactoring, by manually analyzing their internal and external software documentation. However, these techniques are limited by their manual process, which hinders their scalability. Hence, in this study, we tackle the detection of refactoring documentation as binary classification problem. We focus on the automatic detection of refactoring activities in commit messages by relying on text-mining, natural language preprocessing, and supervised machine learning techniques. We design our tool to overcome the limitation of the manual process, previously proposed by existing studies, through exploring the transformation of commit messages into features that are used to train various models. For our evaluation, we use and compare five different binary classification algorithms, and we test the effectiveness of these models using an existing dataset of manually curated messages that are known to be documenting refactoring activities in the source code. The experiments are carried out with different data sizes and number of bits. As per our results, the combination of Chi-Squared with Bayes point machine and Fisher score with Bayes point machine could be the most efficient when it comes to automatically identifying refactoring text patterns in commit messages, with an accuracy of 0.96, and an F-score of 0.96.

6630	ModelGuidance	An empirical study of Q&A websites for game developers	The game development industry is growing, and training new developers in game development-specific abilities is essential to satisfying its need for skilled game developers. These developers require effective learning resources to acquire the information they need and improve their game development skills. Question and Answer (Q&A) websites stand out as some of the most used online learning resources in software development. Many studies have investigated how Q&A websites help software developers become more experienced. However, no studies have explored Q&A websites aimed at game development, and there is little information about how game developers use and interact with these websites. In this paper, we study four Q&A communities by analyzing game development data we collected from their websites and the 347 responses received on a survey we ran with game developers. We observe that the communities have declined over the past few years and identify factors that correlate to these changes. Using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, we characterize the topics discussed in the communities. We also analyze how topics differ across communities and identify the most discussed topics. Furthermore, we find that survey respondents have a mostly negative view of the communities and tended to stop using the websites once they became more experienced. Finally, we provide recommendations on where game developers should post their questions, which can help mitigate the websites' declines and improve their effectiveness.

6642	ModelGuidance	Predictive Mutation Analysis via the Natural Language Channel in Source Code	Mutation analysis can provide valuable insights into both the system under test and its test suite. However, it is not scalable due to the cost of building and testing a large number of mutants. Predictive Mutation Testing (PMT) has been proposed to reduce the cost of mutation testing, but it can only provide statistical inference about whether a mutant will be killed or not by the entire test suite. We propose Seshat, a Predictive Mutation Analysis (PMA) technique that can accurately predict theentire kill matrix, not just the Mutation Score (MS) of the given test suite. Seshat exploits the natural language channel in code, and learns the relationship between the syntactic and semantic concepts of each test case and the mutants it can kill, from a given kill matrix. The learnt model can later be used to predict the kill matrices for subsequent versions of the program, even after both the source and test code have changed significantly. Empirical evaluation using the programs inDefects4Jshows that Seshat can predict kill matrices with an average F-score of 0.83 for versions that are up to years apart. This is an improvement in F-score by 0.14 and 0.45 points over the state-of-the-art PMT technique and a simple coverage-based heuristic, respectively. Seshat also performs as well as PMT for the prediction of the MS only.When applied to a mutant-based fault localisation technique, the predicted kill matrix by Seshat is successfully used to locate faults within the top 10 position, showing its usefulness beyond prediction of MS.Once Seshat trains its model using a concrete mutation analysis, the subsequent predictions made by Seshat are on average 39 times faster than actual test-based analysis.We also show that Seshat can be successfully applied to automatically generated test cases with an experiment using EvoSuite.

6947	ModelGuidance	Architectural Concepts for IEC 61499-based Machine Controls: Beyond Normal Operation Handling	Modern production systems are constantly getting more complex and moving towards smaller lot sizes and more customizable products. This poses new challenges on the control software, which is growing in size and complexity. To deal with this increasingly large and complex control software, design guidelines are needed. We are working on such design guidelines for IEC 61499, a modeling language for distributed control systems.

7528	ModelGuidance	POLYGLOT for Gamified Education: Mixing Modelling and Programming Exercises	Gamification refers to the employment of gaming mechanisms for non-gaming purposes. Its aim is promoting the engagement of target users in pursuing certain goals, e.g. completing education paths. In this paper we present POLYGLOT, a gamified notebook-like programming environment. The gamification extension was built to target programming languages education, and in this work we illustrate how the approach is adaptable to text-based modelling languages. In particular, we demonstrate the use of gamification tailored to SysML v2 modelling.Each exercise is defined as a sequence of steps framed into notebook cells. On each cell submission, the POLYGLOT extension for.NET interactive runs several analyzers to gain insights of the student code before invoking the gamification engine, which checks if the gathered data fits the teacher-defined expectations. Interestingly, since cell contents are language independent and exercise evaluations are delegated to the gamification engine, this solution enables the creation of heterogeneous narratives, that is gamification scenarios mixing languages in the proposed exercises.

7953	ModelGuidance	Towards an Effective Implementation of a Model-Driven Engineering Approach for Software Development	Several studies have raised the issue of the adoption of model-driven engineering (MDE) in industry. We can find there, for example, the lack of mature tools and the lack of employee training. In this paper, we present a summary of 20 years of experience in MDE and how our vision has evolved through all these years. We present our view of an effective approach for a better application of MDE which answers to some of the issues raised. This approach is supported by a set of integrated tools that facilitate not only the learning of MDE but also its implementation. We also discuss some of the results of adopting this approach in university software engineering courses and its use in real software development projects.

8195	ModelGuidance	Reading to write code:an experience report of a reverse engineering and modeling course	"A substantial portion of any software engineer's job is reading code. Despite the criticality of this skill in a budding software engineer, reading code---and more specifically, techniques on how to read code when integrating oneself into a large existing software project---is often neglected in the typical software engineering education. As part of a new professional Master of Software Engineering at the University of California, Irvine, we designed and delivered a ""reading to write code"" course from the ground up. Titled Reverse Engineering and Modeling, the course introduces students to techniques they can use to become familiar with a large code base, so they are able to make meaningful contributions. In this paper, we briefly introduce the Master program and its underlying philosophy, articulate the course's learning outcomes, present the design of the course, and provide a detailed reflection on our experiences in terms of what went well, what did not go well, what we do not know yet, and what our next steps are in preparing for the forthcoming incarnation of the course in Spring 2022. In so doing, we hope to provide a baseline together with lessons learned for others who may be interested in instituting a similar course at their institution."	large open source systems; reading code; software understanding	Brooke Ryan; Adriana Meza Soria; Kaj Dreef; Andre van der Hoek	ICSE-SEET '22: Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 44th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering Education and Training	https://doi.org/10.1145/3510456.3514164		223-234		Excluded	Excluded	new_screen			2	ACM		Reading to Write Code: An Experience Report of a Reverse Engineering and Modeling Course	https://doi.org/10.1145/3510456.3514164	Association for Computing Machinery	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link

8496	ModelGuidance	A holonic approach of manufacturing systems modeling and simulation	The paper presents a solution for holonic control of smart manufacturing systems, using a mix of digitization procedures that capitalize on the possibilities offered by a Digital Twin simulation environment in modeling and simulating both the physical entities of the industrial plant and of the execution phases of the production process. The main novelty is the creation of software assets by encapsulating FBs in holon-type containers, which can be used both in the design phase and in the production control phase. The validation of the solution was performed on a mechatronic laboratory line, specialized for assembly and disassembly operations.

    abstract = ""The paper presents a solution for holonic control of smart manufacturing systems, using a mix of digitization procedures that capitalize on the possibilities offered by a Digital Twin simulation environment in modeling and simulating both the physical entities of the industrial plant and of the execution phases of the production process. The main novelty is the creation of software assets by encapsulating FBs in holon-type containers, which can be used both in the design phase and in the production control phase. The validation of the solution was performed on a mechatronic laboratory line, specialized for assembly and disassembly operations."",
