0	ESM_2	Tailoring persuasive health games to gamer type	Persuasive games are an effective approach for motivating health behavior, and recent years have seen an increase in games designed for changing human behaviors or attitudes. However, these games are limited in two major ways: first, they are not based on theories of what motivates healthy behavior change. This makes it difficult to evaluate why a persuasive approach works. Second, most persuasive games treat players as a monolithic group. As an attempt to resolve these weaknesses, we conducted a large-scale survey of 642 gamers' eating habits and their associated determinants of healthy behavior to understand how health behavior relates to gamer type. We developed seven different models of healthy eating behavior for the gamer types identified by BrainHex. We then explored the differences between the models and created two approaches for effective persuasive game design based on our results. The first is a one-size-fits-all approach that will motivate the majority of the population, while not demotivating any players. The second is a personalized approach that will best motivate a particular type of gamer. Finally, to make our approaches actionable in persuasive game design, we map common game mechanics to the determinants of healthy behavior.	behavior theory;  gamer types;  games design;  hbm;  health;  persuasive game;  player typology;  serious games	Orji, Rita; Mandryk, Regan L.; Vassileva, Julita; Gerling, Kathrin M.

1	ESM_2	CoachAI: A Conversational Agent Assisted Health Coaching Platform	Poor lifestyle represents a health risk factor and is the leading cause of morbidity and chronic conditions. The impact of poor lifestyle can be significantly altered by individual behavior change. Although the current shift in healthcare towards a long lasting modifiable behavior, however, with increasing caregiver workload and individuals' continuous needs of care, there is a need to ease caregiver's work while ensuring continuous interaction with users. This paper describes the design and validation of CoachAI, a conversational agent assisted health coaching system to support health intervention delivery to individuals and groups. CoachAI instantiates a text based healthcare chatbot system that bridges the remote human coach and the users. This research provides three main contributions to the preventive healthcare and healthy lifestyle promotion: (1) it presents the conversational agent to aid the caregiver; (2) it aims to decrease caregiver's workload and enhance care given to users, by handling (automating) repetitive caregiver tasks; and (3) it presents a domain independent mobile health conversational agent for health intervention delivery. We will discuss our approach and analyze the results of a one month validation study on physical activity, healthy diet and stress management.

2	ESM_2	FitChat: Conversational Artificial Intelligence Interventions for Encouraging Physical Activity in Older Adults	"Delivery of digital behaviour change interventions which encourage physical activity has been tried in many forms. Most often interventions are delivered as text notifications, but these do not promote interaction. Advances in conversational AI have improved natural language understanding and generation, allowing AI chatbots to provide an engaging experience with the user. For this reason, chatbots have recently been seen in healthcare delivering digital interventions through free text or choice selection. In this work, we explore the use of voice-based AI chatbots as a novel mode of intervention delivery, specifically targeting older adults to encourage physical activity. We co-created ""FitChat"", an AI chatbot, with older adults and we evaluate the first prototype using Think Aloud Sessions. Our thematic evaluation suggests that older adults prefer voice-based chat over text notifications or free text entry and that voice is a powerful mode for encouraging motivation."

3	ESM_2	Assistive Conversational Agent for Health Coaching: A Validation Study	Objective Poor lifestyle represents a health risk factor and is the leading cause of morbidity and chronic conditions. The impact of poor lifestyle can be significantly altered by individual's behavioral modification. Although there are abundant lifestyle promotion applications and tools, they are still limited in providing tailored social support that goes beyond their predefined functionalities. In addition, virtual coaching approaches are still unable to handle user emotional needs. Our approach presents a human-virtual agent mediated system that leverages the conversational agent to handle menial caregiver's works by engaging users (e.g., patients) in a conversation with the conversational agent. The dialog used a natural conversation to interact with users, delivered by the conversational agent and handled with a finite state machine automaton. Our research differs from existing approaches that replace a human coach with a fully automated assistant on user support. The methodology allows users to interact with the technology and access health-related interventions. To assist physicians, the conversational agent gives weighting to user's adherence, based on prior defined conditions. Materials and Methods This article describes the design and validation of CoachAI, a conversational agent-assisted health coaching system to support health intervention delivery to individuals or groups. CoachAI instantiates a text-based health care conversational agent system that bridges the remote human coach and the users. Results We will discuss our approach and highlight the outcome of a 1-month validation study on physical activity, healthy diet, and stress coping. The study validates technology aspects of our human-virtual agent mediated health coaching system. We present the intervention settings and findings from the study. In addition, we present some user-experience validation results gathered during or after the experimentation. Conclusions The study provided a set of dimensions when building a human-conversational agent powered health intervention tool. The results provided interesting insights when using human-conversational agent mediated approach in health coaching systems. The findings revealed that users who were highly engaged were also more adherent to conversational-agent activities. This research made key contributions to the literature on techniques in providing social, yet tailored health coaching support: (1) identifying habitual patterns to understand user preferences; (2) the role of a conversational agent in delivering health promoting microactivities; (3) building the technology while adhering to individuals' daily messaging routine; and (4) a socio-technical system that fits with the role of conversational agent as an assistive component. Future Work Future improvements will consider building the activity recommender based on users' interaction data and integrating users' dietary pattern and emotional wellbeing into the initial user clustering by leveraging information and communication technology approaches (e.g., machine learning). We will integrate a sentiment analysis capability to gather further data about individuals and report these data to the caregiver.

4	ESM_2	Indoor wayfinding: Developing a functional interface for individuals with cognitive impairments	Purpose. Assistive technology for wayfinding will significantly improve the quality of life for many individuals with cognitive impairments. The user interface of such a system is as crucial as the underlying implementation and localisation technology. We studied the user interface of an indoor navigation system for individuals with cognitive impairments. Method. We built a system using the Wizard-of-Oz technique that let us experiment with many guidance strategies and interface modalities. Through user studies, we evaluated various configurations of the user interface for accuracy of route completion, time to completion, and user preferences. We used a counter-balanced design that included different modalities (images, audio, and text) and different routes. Results. We found that although users were able to use all types of modalities to find their way indoors, they varied significantly in their preferred modalities. We also found that timing of directions requires careful attention, as does providing users with confirmation messages at appropriate times. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that the ability to adapt indoor wayfinding devices for specific users' preferences and needs will be particularly important.

6	ESM_2	LunchTime: A slow-casual game for long-term dietary behavior change	Eating out has recently become part of our lifestyle. However, when eating out in restaurants, many people find it difficult to make meal choices consistent with their health goals. Bad eating choices and habits are in part responsible for the alarming increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure, which burden the health care system. Therefore, there is a need for an intervention that educates the public on how to make healthy choices while eating away from home. In this paper, we propose a goal-based slow-casual game approach that addresses this need. This approach acknowledges different groups of users with varying health goals and adopts slow technology to promote learning and reflection. We model two recognized determinants of well-being into dietary interventions and provide feedback accordingly. To demonstrate the suitability of our approach for long-term sustained learning, reflection, and attitude and/or behavior change, we develop and evaluate LunchTime - a goal-based slow-casual game that educates players on how to make healthier meal choices. The result from the evaluation shows that LunchTime facilitates learning and reflection and promotes positive dietary attitude change.

    abstract = ""Eating out has recently become part of our lifestyle. However, when eating out in restaurants, many people find it difficult to make meal choices consistent with their health goals. Bad eating choices and habits are in part responsible for the alarming increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure, which burden the health care system. Therefore, there is a need for an intervention that educates the public on how to make healthy choices while eating away from home. In this paper, we propose a goal-based slow-casual game approach that addresses this need. This approach acknowledges different groups of users with varying health goals and adopts slow technology to promote learning and reflection. We model two recognized determinants of well-being into dietary interventions and provide feedback accordingly. To demonstrate the suitability of our approach for long-term sustained learning, reflection, and attitude and/or behavior change, we develop and evaluate LunchTime - a goal-based slow-casual game that educates players on how to make healthier meal choices. The result from the evaluation shows that LunchTime facilitates learning and reflection and promotes positive dietary attitude change. (c) 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited."",

7	ESM_2	Towards personality-driven persuasive health games and gamified systems	Persuasive games and gamified systems are effective tools for motivating behavior change using various persuasive strategies. Research has shown that tailoring these systems can increase their efficacy. However, there is little knowledge on how game-based persuasive systems can be tailored to individuals of various personality traits. To advance research in this area, we conducted a large-scale study of 660 participants to investigate how different personalities respond to various persuasive strategies that are used in persuasive health games and gamified systems. Our results reveal that people's personality traits play a significant role in the perceived persuasiveness of different strategies. Conscientious people tend to be motivated by goal setting, simulation, self-monitoring and feedback; people who are more open to experience are more likely to be demotivated by rewards, competition, comparison, and cooperation. We contribute to the CHI community by offering design guidelines for tailoring persuasive games and gamified designs to a particular group of personalities.

9	ESM_2	Understanding the effect of existing positive relationships on a social motion-based game for health	In this paper, we present the iterative design of StepQuest, a Fitbit-based social motion-based game for health (MGH) to sustain physical activity (PA) and support extended play. We conducted two 6-week user studies (n=24) to evaluate the effectiveness of the game to promote PA for an extended period of time as well as the role of existing social relationship. Our findings indicate that a pre-existing positive relationship (e.g., friendship) has a positive impact on players' PA levels when they play a social MGH, compared to strangers, and that this effect was amplified when more gameplay actions were available. However, our results also show that overall PA levels declined for both groups in week 4, and that preexisting social relationship and a variety of gameplay actions are not enough to sustain long-term motivation for PA. Based on these results and drawing from game design literature, we present a list of design implications including less-discussed key topics such as game balancing.

10	ESM_2	Improving the efficacy of cognitive training for digital mental health interventions through avatar customization: Crowdsourced quasi-experimental study	Background: The success of internet-based mental health interventions in practice--that is, in the wild--depends on the uptake and retention of the application and the user's focused attention in the moment of use. Incorporating game-based motivational design into digital interventions delivered in the wild has been shown to increase uptake and retention in internet-based training; however, there are outstanding questions about the potential of game-based motivational strategies to increase engagement with a task in the moment of use and the effect on intervention efficacy. Objective: Designers of internet-based interventions need to know whether game-based motivational design strategies can increase in-the-moment engagement and thus improve digital interventions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 1 motivational design strategy (avatar customization) in an example mental health intervention (computerized cognitive training for attention bias modification). Methods: We assigned 317 participants to either a customized avatar or an assigned avatar condition. After measuring state anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), we randomly assigned half of the participants in each condition to either an attentional retraining condition (Attention Bias Modification Training) or a control condition. After training, participants were exposed to a negative mood induction using images with strong negative valance (International Affective Picture System), after which we measured state anxiety again. Results: Avatar customization decreased posttraining state anxiety when controlling for baseline state anxiety for those in the attentional retraining condition; however, those who did not train experienced decreased resilience to the negative mood induction (F1,252=6.86, P=.009, ep 2=.027). This interaction effect suggests that customization increased task engagement with the intervention in the moment of use. Avatar customization also increased avatar identification (F5,252=12.46, P<.001, R2=.23), regardless of condition (F1,252=.79, P=.38). Avatar identification reduced anxiety after the negative mood induction for participants who underwent training but increased poststimulus anxiety for participants who did not undergo training, further suggesting that customization increases engagement in the task (F1,252=6.19, P=.01). The beneficial effect of avatar customization on training was driven by participants who were low in their basic satisfaction of relatedness (F10,248=18.5, P<.001, R2=.43), which is important because these are the participants who are most likely in need of digital interventions for mental health. Conclusions: Our results suggest that applying motivational design--specifically avatar customization--is a viable strategy to increase engagement and subsequently training efficacy in a computerized cognitive task.

    abstract = ""Background: The success of internet-based mental health interventions in practice--that is, in the wild--depends on the uptake and retention of the application and the user's focused attention in the moment of use. Incorporating game-based motivational design into digital interventions delivered in the wild has been shown to increase uptake and retention in internet-based training; however, there are outstanding questions about the potential of game-based motivational strategies to increase engagement with a task in the moment of use and the effect on intervention efficacy. Objective: Designers of internet-based interventions need to know whether game-based motivational design strategies can increase in-the-moment engagement and thus improve digital interventions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 1 motivational design strategy (avatar customization) in an example mental health intervention (computerized cognitive training for attention bias modification). Methods: We assigned 317 participants to either a customized avatar or an assigned avatar condition. After measuring state anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), we randomly assigned half of the participants in each condition to either an attentional retraining condition (Attention Bias Modification Training) or a control condition. After training, participants were exposed to a negative mood induction using images with strong negative valance (International Affective Picture System), after which we measured state anxiety again. Results: Avatar customization decreased posttraining state anxiety when controlling for baseline state anxiety for those in the attentional retraining condition; however, those who did not train experienced decreased resilience to the negative mood induction (F1,252=6.86, P=.009, ep 2=.027). This interaction effect suggests that customization increased task engagement with the intervention in the moment of use. Avatar customization also increased avatar identification (F5,252=12.46, P<.001, R2=.23), regardless of condition (F1,252=.79, P=.38). Avatar identification reduced anxiety after the negative mood induction for participants who underwent training but increased poststimulus anxiety for participants who did not undergo training, further suggesting that customization increases engagement in the task (F1,252=6.19, P=.01). The beneficial effect of avatar customization on training was driven by participants who were low in their basic satisfaction of relatedness (F10,248=18.5, P<.001, R2=.43), which is important because these are the participants who are most likely in need of digital interventions for mental health. Conclusions: Our results suggest that applying motivational design--specifically avatar customization--is a viable strategy to increase engagement and subsequently training efficacy in a computerized cognitive task.

11	ESM_2	Effects of a personalized fitness recommender system using gamification and continuous player modeling: System design and long-term validation study	Background: Gamification and persuasive games are effective tools to motivate behavior change, particularly to promote daily physical activities. On the one hand, studies have suggested that a one-size-fits-all approach does not work well for persuasive game design. On the other hand, player modeling and recommender systems are increasingly used for personalizing content. However, there are few existing studies on how to build comprehensive player models for personalizing gamified systems, recommending daily physical activities, or the long-term effectiveness of such gamified exercise-promoting systems. Objective: This paper aims to introduce a gamified, 24/7 fitness assistant system that provides personalized recommendations and generates gamified content targeted at individual users to bridge the aforementioned gaps. This research aims to investigate how to design gamified physical activity interventions to achieve long-term engagement. Methods: We proposed a comprehensive model for gamified fitness recommender systems that uses detailed and dynamic player modeling and wearable-based tracking to provide personalized game features and activity recommendations. Data were collected from 40 participants (23 men and 17 women) who participated in a long-term investigation on the effectiveness of our recommender system that gradually establishes and updates an individual player model (for each unique user) over a period of 60 days. Results: Our results showed the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system, particularly for generating personalized exercise recommendations using player modeling. There was a statistically significant difference among the 3 groups (full, personalized, and gamified) for overall motivation (F3,36=22.49; P<.001), satisfaction (F3,36=22.12; P<.001), and preference (F3,36=15.0; P<.001), suggesting that both gamification and personalization have positive effects on the levels of motivation, satisfaction, and preference. Furthermore, qualitative results revealed that a customized storyline was the most requested feature, followed by a multiplayer mode, more quality recommendations, a feature for setting and tracking fitness goals, and more location-based features. Conclusions: On the basis of these results and drawing from the gamer modeling literature, we conclude that personalizing recommendations using player modeling and gamification can improve participants' engagement and motivation toward fitness activities over time.

12	ESM_2	Nourish Your Tree! Developing a Persuasive Exergame for Promoting Physical Activity among Adults	In this paper, we present the design and development of a persuasive game for promoting physical activity and discouraging sedentariness. The game is based on the tree metaphor which links a player's physical activity level (operationalized using step count) to the health of a tree. Thus, as the player becomes physically active (such as walking or running), the tree's health improves. The tree withers if player's physical activity level reduces. The game employs various persuasive strategies based on the Persuasive Systems Design (PSD) framework to boost players' motivation and provide an enjoyable experience. We believe that our game will yield improved physical activity levels among adults by encouraging them to regularly engage in light-intensity activity (e.g., slow-walking), moderate-intensity activity (e.g., brisk-walking), and vigorous-intensity activity (e.g., running). By being physically active, players protect themselves from chronic health conditions and improve their emotional and mental well-being.

13	ESM_2	Motivation-based approach for tailoring persuasive mental health applications	The growing number of people with mental health issues and the worldwide shortage of professionals emphasise the need for tailored persuasive interventions. This paper explores the relationships between the types of motivation individuals experience and their preferences for various features that are widely used in persuasive apps for mental and emotional well-being. First, we reviewed 103 mental health apps from app stores and identified various persuasive features and then conducted focus-group studies of 32 participants. Finally, we implemented the common features in persuasive mental health app prototypes and conducted a large-scale study of 561 users to evaluate their perceived effectiveness. The results reveal that people's motivation types significantly influence the perceived persuasiveness of different features. People high in intrinsic motivation are more motivated by apps that offer relaxation exercises while providing opportunities to track various mental health-related information. We offer design guidelines for tailoring persuasive mental health apps based on motivation types.

14	ESM_2	Back on bike: The BoB mobile cycling app for secondary prevention in cardiac patients	Persons that suffered from a cardiac disease are often recommended to integrate a sufficient level of physical exercise in their daily life. Initially, cardiac rehabilitation takes place in a closely monitored setting in a hospital or a rehabilitation center. Sustaining the effort once the patient has left the ambulatory, supervised environment is a challenge, and drop-out rates are high. Emerging approaches such as telemonitoring and telerehabilitation have been proven to show the potential to support the cardiac patient in adhering to the advised physical exercise. However, most telerehabilitation solutions only support a limited range of physical exercise, such as step-counting during walking. We propose BoB (Back on Bike), a mobile application that guides cardiac patients while cycling. Design choices are explained according to three pillars: ease of use, reduce fear, and direct and indirect motivation. In this paper, we report the results from a field study with cardiac patients.

15	ESM_2	Android based health care system for aged diabetic patients	Diabetes mellitus is an illness that requires continuing medical care and self-management system for the patients to prevent acute complications to reduce the risk of long-term complications. It is a complex disease in which the care for health is supposed to be a satisfactory daily prescribed diet and practicing regular habits, in addition to proper medication and treatment. Good diet and exercise habits, as well as continuous monitoring of blood pressure and sugar are all important for a diabetic patient in order to maintain his proper health. Although there are too many health care solutions exist in the market today, but none of them focus on providing a personalized health care management system for the patient. This proposed mobile application will take an effort to ensure a healthy balanced diet for the patients with the synchronization of balancing food energy. The system provides more facilities by giving the chance to set the medicine alarms, monitoring blood pressure and sugar levels in a chart. The system also provides more safety by making emergency calls and messages in real-time by utilizing GPS reporting technology considering the crucial moment of the patient. Two surveys are included in order to show the necessity of the implementation.

It is a complex disease in which the care for health is supposed to be a satisfactory daily prescribed diet and practicing regular habits, in addition to proper medication and treatment. Good diet and exercise habits, as well as continuous monitoring of blood pressure and sugar are all important for a diabetic patient in order to maintain his proper health. Although there are too many health care solutions exist in the market today, but none of them focus on providing a personalized health care management system for the patient. This proposed mobile application will take an effort to ensure a healthy balanced diet for the patients with the synchronization of balancing food energy. The system provides more facilities by giving the chance to set the medicine alarms, monitoring blood pressure and sugar levels in a chart. The system also provides more safety by making emergency calls and messages in real-time by utilizing GPS reporting technology considering the crucial moment of the patient. Two surveys are included in order to show the necessity of the implementation."",

16	ESM_2	iCare: A mobile health monitoring system for the elderly	This paper describes a mobile health monitoring system called iCare for the elderly. We use wireless body sensors and smart phones to monitor the wellbeing of the elderly. It can offer remote monitoring for the elderly anytime anywhere and provide tailored services for each person based on their personal health condition. When detecting an emergency, the smart phone will automatically alert pre-assigned people who could be the old people's family and friends, and call the ambulance of the emergency centre. It also acts as the personal health information system and the medical guidance which offers one communication platform and the medical knowledge database so that the family and friends of the served people can cooperate with doctors to take care of him/her. The system also features some unique functions that cater to the living demands of the elderly, including regular reminder, quick alarm, medical guidance, etc. iCare is not only a real-time health monitoring system for the elderly, but also a living assistant which can make their lives more convenient and comfortable.

18	ESM_2	I-CARE-An Interaction System for the Individual Activation of People with Dementia	I-CARE is a hand-held activation system that allows professional and informal caregivers to cognitively and socially activate people with dementia in joint activation sessions without special training or expertise. I-CARE consists of an easy-to-use tablet application that presents activation content and a server-based backend system that securely manages the contents and events of activation sessions. It tracks various sources of explicit and implicit feedback from user interactions and different sensors to estimate which content is successful in activating individual users. Over the course of use, I-CARE's recommendation system learns about the individual needs and resources of its users and automatically personalizes the activation content. In addition, information about past sessions can be retrieved such that activations seamlessly build on previous sessions while eligible stakeholders are informed about the current state of care and daily form of their protegees. In addition, caregivers can connect with supervisors and professionals through the I-CARE remote calling feature, to get activation sessions tracked in real time via audio and video support. In this way, I-CARE provides technical support for a decentralized and spontaneous formation of ad hoc activation groups and fosters tight engagement of the social network and caring community. By these means, I-CARE promotes new care infrastructures in the community and the neighborhood as well as relieves professional and informal caregivers.Keywords:activation for people with dementia; intelligent services; professional and informal caregivers; recommendation system; technical assistance.

20	ESM_2	On the Adaptability and Applicability of Multi-touch User Interfaces Addressing Behavioral Interventions for Children with Autism	Principles of human-computer interaction (HCI) are imperative when it comes to efficient user interface design. This becomes even more significant when the interface is for users with special needs and especially when there is a treatment methodology incorporated in a piece of software. This study investigates user interfaces that are specifically made for children with autism-spectrum disorders. We conducted a survey to evaluate the adaptability and applicability of various interfaces. For this, we selected four of the behavioral interventions for autism namely discrete trial training (DTT), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), empathy enhancement and verbal behavior approach (VBA). User interfaces (UIs) of 16 software applications were assessed for the said features. Results of this assessment revealed that these Applications were adaptable to two behavioral interventions, on the average. Moreover, these Applications were simultaneously applicable for treatment of three levels of autism; namely high functioning, low functioning, and autistic adults. These interfaces were also applicable to the children with no autism (typically developing) who acted as a controlled group.

22	ESM_2	Emerald--exercise monitoring emotional assistant	The increase in the elderly population in today's society entails the need for new policies to maintain an adequate level of care without excessively increasing social spending. One of the possible options is to promote home care for the elderly. In this sense, this paper introduces a personal assistant designed to help elderly people in their activities of daily living. This system, called EMERALD, is comprised of a sensing platform and different mechanisms for emotion detection and decision-making that combined produces a cognitive assistant that engages users in Active Aging. The contribution of the paper is twofold--on the one hand, the integration of low-cost sensors that among other characteristics allows for detecting the emotional state of the user at an affordable cost; on the other hand, an automatic activity suggestion module that engages the users, mainly oriented to the elderly, in a healthy lifestyle. Moreover, by continuously correcting the system using the on-line monitoring carried out through the sensors integrated in the system, the system is personalized, and, in broad terms, emotionally intelligent.

    abstract = ""The increase in the elderly population in today's society entails the need for new policies to maintain an adequate level of care without excessively increasing social spending. One of the possible options is to promote home care for the elderly. In this sense, this paper introduces a personal assistant designed to help elderly people in their activities of daily living. This system, called EMERALD, is comprised of a sensing platform and different mechanisms for emotion detection and decision-making that combined produces a cognitive assistant that engages users in Active Aging. The contribution of the paper is twofold--on the one hand, the integration of low-cost sensors that among other characteristics allows for detecting the emotional state of the user at an affordable cost; on the other hand, an automatic activity suggestion module that engages the users, mainly oriented to the elderly, in a healthy lifestyle. Moreover, by continuously correcting the system using the on-line monitoring carried out through the sensors integrated in the system, the system is personalized, and, in broad terms, emotionally intelligent. A functional prototype is being currently tested in a daycare centre in the northern area of Portugal where preliminary tests show positive results. (c) 2019 by the authors.

23	ESM_2	ME3CA: A Cognitive Assistant for Physical Exercises that Monitors Emotions and the Environment	Recent studies show that the elderly population has increased considerably in European society in recent years. This fact has led the European Union and many countries to propose new policies for caring services directed to this group. The current trend is to promote the care of the elderly in their own homes, thus avoiding inverting resources on residences. With this in mind, there are now new solutions in this direction, which try to make use of the continuous advances in computer science. This paper tries to advance in this area by proposing the use of a personal assistant to help older people at home while carrying out their daily activities. The proposed personal assistant is called ME3CA, and can be described as a cognitive assistant that offers users a personalised exercise plan for their rehabilitation. The system consists of a sensorisation platform along with decision-making algorithms paired with emotion detection models. ME3CA detects the users’ emotions, which are used in the decision-making process allowing for more precise suggestions and an accurate (and unbiased) knowledge about the users’ opinion towards each exercise.,” vol. 20, no. 3, 2020, doi: 10.3390/s20030852.

24	ESM_2	User Centered Design of an Interactive Mobile Assistance and Supervision System for Rehabilitation Purposes	This paper describes the user centered development of a mobile assistance and supervision system for cardiac disease patients. Smartphones are used to collect data from wireless sensors like ECG, blood pressure or oxygen saturation sensors while a patient is exercising outdoors. All data from the wireless sensors as well as GPS information is sent to a supervision center where doctors and sport therapists analyze the data in a collaborative and interactive setting. We here present the User Centered Design process, the technical realization as well as the interaction modalities of our system.

25	ESM_2	Designing a Telemedical System for Cardiac Exercise Rehabilitation	Since cardiac diseases cause the major amount of money spent in medical care, IT solutions that support patients in the rehabilitation phase are desirable. Such systems can motivate and guide patients in order to exercise frequently and hence to avoid another cardiac event. Such telemedical applications have posses a very special and heterogeneous user group. Therefore User Centered Design is crucial. We present a system setup and user interface design that was prototypically build for this kind of patients.

26	ESM_2	User centered design of patient user interfaces for remote training supervision: A user study	Remote training supervision is a new approach that combines medical and IT knowledge into one system. Such a system enables patients with cardiac diseases to continue a supervised training - on an ergometer bicycle and even when exercising outdoors - after rehabilitation phase in a clinic. The goal of the study presented in this paper is to develop user interfaces for an ergometer. These interfaces have to allow an intuitive interaction and to take the different capabilities, needs and preferences of potential users - often elderly people having visual impairments and different IT knowledge - into account. In order to create minimal attention user interfaces it is mandatory to apply user centered techniques, which involve potential users into the design phase of the development process. The evaluation of the study served as basis for the next iteration of the user centered design process and raised new functional requirements to the underlying system from the user's perspective.

27	ESM_2	A Kinect based adaptive exergame	This paper describes an application that aims to stimulate physical activity adapted to elderly people. The application is implemented as a game with two avatars: user and trainer. The user avatar must reproduce the movements of the trainer's avatar. The similarity between two movements is computed using Dynamic Time Warping. Also the speed of the trainer is adapted to the user's movements using cross-correlation. Thus the game can stimulate for a long time physically activity. The preliminary evaluations with ten people have shown that the system can be an effective tool that engages users into physical activity.

29	ESM_2	Adaptive strategy for multi-user robotic rehabilitation games	In this paper, we discuss a strategy for the adaptation of the difficulty level in games intended to include motor planning during robotic rehabilitation. We consider concurrently the motivation of the user and his/her performance in a Pong game. User motivation is classified in three levels (not motivated, well motivated and overloaded). User performance is measured as a combination of knowledge of results-achieved goals and score points in the game and knowledge of performance joint displacement, speed, aiming, user work, etc. Initial results of a pilot test with unimpaired healthy young volunteers are also presented showing a tendency for individualization of the parameter values.

30	ESM_2	Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment Through Real-Time Physiological Feedback for a More Adapted Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy	Like many researchers, we think that the use of dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) to offer an appropriate balance between the skills of the player and the difficulty of the gameplay is an appropriate avenue to maintain the flow of a user. We analyze this approach in a virtual reality serious game dedicated to people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Knowing that heart rate is a good indicator of the emotional state of people with PTSD, we collect this variable in real-time to propose a virtual reality dynamic adjusted system based on the emotional state of the subject. The proposed adaptation system can be approached in three modes: the offline mode which consists on therapist selections before launching the game, the manual online mode during which the therapist can adapt the virtual environment while the subject is exposed, and the computational online mode that runs a DDA algorithm to automatically adjust the game.

31	ESM_2	Ski for Squat: A Squat Exergame with Pneumatic Gel Muscle-Based Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment	We propose a safe design of squat exergame to maintain lower extremity strength that includes Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA). This is to optimise the game difficulty according to a Knee Shakiness (KS) parameter. We modulated two parameters to implement DDA namely, movement speed and Pneumatic Gel Muscle (PGM)-based assistance. The movement speed of the user relates to the frequency of squatting, and the PGM-based assistance was provided by pneumatic actuators called PGMs attached on the hip and knee joints of the lower extremity. We provided variable PGM-based assistance during the onset phase of the squat and a fixed PGM-based resistance during the end phase of the squat. We used collectible spherical objects in the exergame to maintain a good squat posture. The squat posture parameters, knee distance and squat depth showed improvement through the proposed design. Introducing DDA could also significantly reduce KS during the squats.

32	ESM_2	MPRL: Multiple-Periodic Reinforcement Learning for difficulty adjustment in rehabilitation games	Generally, the difficulty level of a therapeutic game is regulated manually by a therapist. However, home-based rehabilitation games require a technique for automatic difficulty adjustment. This paper proposes a personalized difficulty adjustment technique for a rehabilitation game that automatically regulates difficulty settings based on a patient's skills in real-time. To this end, ideas from reinforcement learning are used to dynamically adjust the difficulty of a game. We show that difficulty adjustment is a multiple-objective problem, in which some objectives might be evaluated at different periods. To address this problem, we propose and use Multiple-Periodic Reinforcement Learning (MPRL) that makes it possible to evaluate different objectives of difficulty adjustment in separate periods. The results of experiments show that MPRL outperforms traditional Multiple-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) in terms of user satisfaction parameters as well as improving the movement skills of patients.

33	ESM_2	Serious games for rehabilitation: Gestural interaction in personalized gamified exercises through a recommender system	One of the principal problems of rehabilitation is that therapy sessions can be boring due the repetition of exercises. Serious games, and in particular exergames in rehabilitation, can motivate, engage and increase patients' adherence to their treatment. Also, the automatic personalization of exercises to each patient can help therapists. Thus, the main objective of this work is to build an intelligent exergame-based rehabilitation system consisting of a platform with an exergame player and a designer tool. The intelligent platform includes a recommender system which analyzes user interactions, along with the user's history, to select new gamified exercises for the user. The main contributions of this paper focus, first, on defining a recommender system based on different difficulty levels and user skills. The recommender system offers the ability to provide the user with a personalized game mode based on his own history and preferences. The results of a triple validation with experts, users and rehabilitation center professionals reveal a positive impact on gestural interaction and rehabilitation uses. Also, different methods are presented for testing the rehabilitation recommender system.

34	ESM_2	Mobile-Based Self-Monitoring for Preventing Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension from Cardiovascular Complication	"Currently, there is less attention to the prevention of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension from cardiovascular complication, although it is the significant cause of death for these patients worldwide. To be prevented from this complication, these patients should develop their self-monitoring skills along with their healthcare journey. Consequently, this paper aims to provide an efficient mobile-based self-monitoring that can encourage patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension to improve their health status. The distinctive point of the proposed mobile application is the trend progression module for demonstrating the progression of four health statuses for the patients. This trend progression is modeled with a fuzzy logic-based method. The rules are generated based on clinical data, lifestyle data, and experience of healthcare professionals. There are eleven healthcare professionals involved in this paper. The experiment with one hundred twenty-one patients shows that the proposed mobile application provides 92% trend progression accuracy compared with healthcare professionals' decisions. The developed mobile application obtains the function satisfaction and performance satisfaction in the ""strongly satisfied"" level. Besides, the developed mobile application can encourage 85% of patients to improve their health statuses. It can be seen that this paper is a new aspect of encouraging patients to concern more about the improvement of their health statuses anywhere and anytime."

    abstract = ""Currently, there is less attention to the prevention of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension from cardiovascular complication, although it is the significant cause of death for these patients worldwide. To be prevented from this complication, these patients should develop their self-monitoring skills along with their healthcare journey. Consequently, this paper aims to provide an efficient mobile-based self-monitoring that can encourage patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension to improve their health status. The distinctive point of the proposed mobile application is the trend progression module for demonstrating the progression of four health statuses for the patients. This trend progression is modeled with a fuzzy logic-based method. The rules are generated based on clinical data, lifestyle data, and experience of healthcare professionals. There are eleven healthcare professionals involved in this paper. The experiment with one hundred twenty-one patients shows that the proposed mobile application provides 92\% trend progression accuracy compared with healthcare professionals' decisions. The developed mobile application obtains the function satisfaction and performance satisfaction in the ""strongly satisfied"" level. Besides, the developed mobile application can encourage 85\% of patients to improve their health statuses. It can be seen that this paper is a new aspect of encouraging patients to concern more about the improvement of their health statuses anywhere and anytime.

35	ESM_2	HeartCare+: A Smart Heart Care Mobile Application for Framingham-Based Early Risk Prediction of Hard Coronary Heart Diseases in Middle East	Background. Healthcare is a challenging, yet so demanding sector that developing countries are paying more attention to recently. Statistics show that rural areas are expected to develop a high rate of heart diseases, which is a leading cause of sudden mortality, in the future. Thus, providing solutions that can assist rural people in detecting the cardiac risks early will be vital for uncovering and even preventing the long-Term complications of cardiac diseases. Methodology. Mobile technology can be effectively utilized to limit the cardiac diseases' prevalence in rural Middle East. This paper proposes a smart mobile solution for early risk detection of hard coronary heart diseases that uses the Framingham scoring model. Results. Smart HeartCare+ mobile app estimates accurately coronary heart diseases' risk over 10 years based on clinical and nonclinical data and classifies the patient risk to low, moderate, or high. HeartCare+ also directs the patients to further treatment recommendations. Conclusion. This work attempts to investigate the effectiveness of the mobile technology in the early risk detection of coronary heart diseases. HeartCare+ app intensifies the communication channel between the lab workers and patients residing in rural areas and cardiologists and specialist residing in urban places.

36	ESM_2	Design and Testing of a Smartphone Application for Real-Time Self-Tracking Diabetes Self-Management Behaviors	Background Type 1 diabetes (T1D) care requires multiple daily self-management behaviors (SMBs). Preliminary studies on SMBs rely mainly on self-reported survey and interview data. There is little information on adult T1D SMBs, along with corresponding compensation techniques (CTs), gathered in real-time. Objective The article aims to use a patient-centered approach to design iDECIDE, a smartphone application that gathers daily diabetes SMBs and CTs related to meal and alcohol intake and exercise in real-time, and contrast patients' actual behaviors against those self-reported with the app. Methods Two usability studies were used to improve iDECIDE's functionality. These were followed by a 30-day pilot test of the redesigned app. A survey designed to capture diabetes SMBs and CTs was administered prior to the 30-day pilot test. Survey results were compared against iDECIDE logs. Results Usability studies revealed that participants desired advanced features for self-tracking meals and alcohol intake. Thirteen participants recorded over 1,200 CTs for carbohydrates during the 30-day study. Participants also recorded 76 alcohol and 166 exercise CTs. Comparisons of survey responses and iDECIDE logs showed mean% (standard deviation) concordance of 77% (25) for SMBs related to meals, where concordance of 100% indicates a perfect match. There was low concordance of 35% (35) and 46% (41) for alcohol and exercise events, respectively. Conclusion The high variability found in SMBs and CTs highlights the need for real-time diabetes self-tracking mechanisms to better understand SMBs and CTs. Future work will use the developed app to collect SMBs and CTs and identify patient-specific diabetes adherence barriers that could be addressed with individualized education interventions.

37	ESM_2	Usability testing of an online self-management program for Adolescents with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis	"Background: A new bilingual (English and French) Internet-basedself- management program, Teens Taking Charge: Managing Arthritis Online, for adolescents with arthritis and their parents was developed following a needs assessment.Objectives: This study explored the usability (user performance and satisfaction) of the self-management program for youth with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and their parents to refine the health portal prototype.Methods: A qualitative study design with semi-structured, audio taped interviews and observation by a trained observer was undertaken with two iterative cyclesto determine the usability (ease of use, efficiency, errors, and user satisfaction) of the user interface and content areas of the intervention. A purposive sample of English-speaking (n = 11; mean age = 15.4, standard deviation [SD] 1.7) and French-speaking (n = 8; mean age = 16.0, SD 1.2) adolescents with JIA and one of their respectiveparents/caregivers were recruited from 2 Canadian tertiary care centers. Descriptive statistics and simple content analyses were used toorganize data into categories that reflected the emerging usability themes.Results: All of the participants had access to a computer/Internet at home; however, adolescents were more comfortable using the computer/Internet than their parents. Adolescents and parents provided similar as well as differing suggestions on how the website user interface could be improved in terms of its usability (navigation; presentation and control usage errors; format and layout; as well as areas for further content development). There were no major differences in usability issues between Englishand French-speaking participants. Minor changes to the website user interface were made and tested in a second cycle of participants.No further usability problems were identified in the second iterative cycle of testing. Teens and parents responded positively to the appearance and theme of the website (ie, promoting self-management) and felt that it was easy to navigate, use, and understand.Participants felt that the content was appropriate and geared to meet the unique needs of adolescents with JIA and their parents as well as English- and French-speaking families. Many participants responded that the interactive features (discussion board,stories of hope, and video clips of youth with JIA) made them feel supported and ""not alone"" in their illness.Conclusions: We describe the usability testing of a self-management health portal designed for English- and French-speaking youth with arthritis and theirparents, which uncovered several usability issues. Usability testingis a crucial step in the development of self-management health portals to ensure that the various end users (youth and parents) have theability to access, understand,and use health-related information andservices that are delivered via the Internet and that they are delivered in an efficient,effective, satisfying, and culturally competentmanner."

Adolescents and parents provided similar as well as differing suggestions on how the website user interface could be improved in terms of its usability (navigation; presentation and control usage errors; format and layout; as well as areas for further content development). There were no major differences in usability issues between Englishand French-speaking participants. Minor changes to the website user interface were made and tested in a second cycle of participants.No further usability problems were identified in the second iterative cycle of testing. Teens and parents responded positively to the appearance and theme of the website (ie, promoting self-management) and felt that it was easy to navigate, use, and understand.Participants felt that the content was appropriate and geared to meet the unique needs of adolescents with JIA and their parents as well as English- and French-speaking families. Many participants responded that the interactive features (discussion board,stories of hope, and video clips of youth with JIA) made them feel supported and ""not alone"" in their illness.Conclusions: We describe the usability testing of a self-management health portal designed for English- and French-speaking youth with arthritis and theirparents, which uncovered several usability issues. Usability testingis a crucial step in the development of self-management health portals to ensure that the various end users (youth and parents) have theability to access, understand,and use health-related information andservices that are delivered via the Internet and that they are delivered in an efficient,effective, satisfying, and culturally competentmanner.},

38	ESM_2	A mobile phone intervention to improve obesity-related health behaviors of adolescents across Europe: Iterative co-design and feasibility study	Background: Promotion of physical activity, healthy eating, adequate sleep, and reduced sedentary behavior in adolescents is a major priority globally given the current increase in population health challenges of noncommunicable diseases and risk factors such as obesity. Adolescents are highly engaged with mobile technology, but the challenge is to engage them with mobile health (mHealth) technology. Recent innovations in mobile technology provide opportunities to promote a healthy lifestyle in adolescents. An increasingly utilized approach to facilitate increased engagement with mHealth technology is to involve potential users in the creation of the technology. Objective: This study aimed to describe the process of and findings from co-designing and prototyping components of the PEGASO Fit for Future (F4F) mHealth intervention for adolescents from different cultural backgrounds. Methods: A total of 74 adolescents aged 13 to 16 years from Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom participated in the co-design of the PEGASO F4F technology. In 3 iterative cycles over 12 months, participants were involved in the co-design, refinement, and feasibility testing of a system consisting of diverse mobile apps with a variety of functions and facilities to encourage healthy weight-promoting behaviors. In the first iteration, participants attended a single workshop session and were presented with mock-ups or early-version prototypes of different apps for user requirements assessment and review. During the second iteration, prototypes of all apps were tested by participants for 1 week at home or school. In the third iteration, further developed prototypes were tested for 2 weeks. Participants' user experience feedback and development ideas were collected through focus groups and completion of questionnaires. Results: For the PEGASO F4F technology to be motivating and engaging, participants suggested that it should (1) allow personalization of the interface, (2) have age-appropriate and easy-to-understand language (of icons, labels, instructions, and notifications), (3) provide easily accessible tutorials on how to use the app or navigate through a game, (4) present a clear purpose and end goal, (5) have an appealing and self-explanatory reward system, (6) offer variation in gamified activities within apps and the serious game, and (7) allow to seek peer support and connect with peers for competitive activities within the technology. Conclusions: Incorporating adolescents' preferences, the PEGASO F4F technology combines the functions of a self-monitoring, entertainment, advisory, and social support tool. This was the first study demonstrating that it is possible to develop a complex mobile phone-based technological system applying the principles of co-design to mHealth technology with adolescents across 3 countries. The findings from this study informed the development of an mHealth system for healthy weight promotion to be tested in a controlled multinational pilot trial.

40	ESM_2	Using persuasive technology to increase physical activity in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by encouraging regular walking: A mixed-methods study exploring opinions and preferences	Background: People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PwCOPD) often experience breathlessness and fatigue, making physical activity challenging. Although many persuasive technologies (such as mobile phone apps) have been designed to support physical activity among members of the general population, current technologies aimed at PwCOPD are underdeveloped and only use a limited range of persuasive technology design principles. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore how acceptable different persuasive technology design principles were considered to be in supporting and encouraging physical activity among PwCOPD. Methods: Three prototypes for mobile apps using different persuasive technology design principles as defined by the persuasive systems design (PSD) model-namely, dialogue support, primary task support, and social support-were developed. Opinions of these prototypes were explored through 28 interviews with PwCOPD, carers, and the health care professionals (HCPs) involved in their care and questionnaires completed by 87 PwCOPD. Participants also ranked how likely individual techniques (eg, competition) would be to convince them to use a technology designed to support physical activity. Data were analyzed using framework analysis, Friedman tests, and Wilcoxon signed rank tests and a convergent mixed methods design was used to integrate findings. Results: The prototypes for mobile apps were received positively by participants. The prototype that used a dialogue support approach was identified as the most likely to be used or recommended by those interviewed, and was perceived as more persuasive than both of the other prototypes (Z=-3.06, P=.002; Z=-5.50, P<.001) by those who completed the questionnaire. PwCOPD identified dialogue support and primary task support techniques as more likely to convince them to use a technology than social support techniques (Z=-5.00, P<.001; Z=-4.92, P<.001, respectively). Opinions of social support techniques such as competition and collaboration were divided. Conclusions: Dialogue support and primary task support approaches are considered to be both acceptable and likely to be persuasive by PwCOPD, carers, and HCPs. In the future, these approaches should be considered when designing apps to encourage physical activity by PwCOPD.

41	ESM_2	Move2Play: An innovative approach to encouraging people to be more physically active	Throughout the last decade, there has been an alarming de- crease in daily physical activity among both children and adults. Medical experts agree that physical activity is crit- ical to maintaining fitness, reducing weight and improving health. Yet so many people have dificulty increasing and maintaining physical activity in everyday life. We have cre- ated a solution calledMove2Play, which encourages a health- ier lifestyle and motivates to participate in regular physical activity. We have integrated four essential parts that form the basis for long-term progress and sustainability - Activity Recommendation, Tracking, Evaluation and Motivation. In order to recognize and assess physical activity, we have developed a system for mobile phones that collects data from various sensors, such as accelerometer, GPS and GSM. We provide personalization, i.e. we have proposed and realized activity recommendation for an individual user to ensure that the users engage in regular exercise, as opposed to oc- casional outbursts of activity, which are unhealthy and even harmful. We discuss our proposed mechanisms of activity recommendation and the concept of motivation, which rep- resent a key element for any system that fights the sedentary lifestyle of the modern generation.

    abstract = ""Throughout the last decade, there has been an alarming de- crease in daily physical activity among both children and adults. Medical experts agree that physical activity is crit- ical to maintaining fitness, reducing weight and improving health. Yet so many people have dificulty increasing and maintaining physical activity in everyday life. We have cre- ated a solution calledMove2Play, which encourages a health- ier lifestyle and motivates to participate in regular physical activity. We have integrated four essential parts that form the basis for long-term progress and sustainability - Activity Recommendation, Tracking, Evaluation and Motivation. In order to recognize and assess physical activity, we have developed a system for mobile phones that collects data from various sensors, such as accelerometer, GPS and GSM. We provide personalization, i.e. we have proposed and realized activity recommendation for an individual user to ensure that the users engage in regular exercise, as opposed to oc- casional outbursts of activity, which are unhealthy and even harmful. We discuss our proposed mechanisms of activity recommendation and the concept of motivation, which rep- resent a key element for any system that fights the sedentary lifestyle of the modern generation.

42	ESM_2	Bounce: Designing a Physical Activity Intervention for Breast Cancer Survivors	The pervasive use of personal mobile devices provides an advantage for the delivery of a behavioral intervention anywhere and anytime. However, behavioral outcomes are dependent on adoption and sustained use of mobile-based interventions. Design approaches for engagement and feasibility of use in everyday life have been studied among the general population, especially to promote physical activity. In this paper, we discuss a design process that addresses additional barriers to adoption when the target population has symptoms, limitations, or needs resulting from a specific health condition. We designed a smartphone-based physical activity intervention for breast cancer survivors by combining behavior change theory with empirical evidence. In a preliminary evaluation, participants found the application engaging and useful, and continued to use the application briefly after the evaluation ended. We illustrate how our design process was used, and could be applied to other specific health conditions.	physical activity;  breast cancer survivors;  Behavioral intervention technology	Marcu, Gabriela; Misra, Anjali; Caro, Karina; Plank, Meghan; Leader, Amy; Barsevick, Andrea	PervasiveHealth '18: Proceedings of the 12th EAI International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare	https://doi.org/10.1145/3240925.3240927		25-34	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3240925.3240927,

43	ESM_2	PhytoCloud: A Gamified Mobile Web Application to Modulate Diet and Physical Activity of Women with Breast Cancer	Breast cancer incidence and mortality rates vary geographically reflecting factors including regional and cultural differences in diet and lifestyle. There are numerous successful commercial mobile apps to help people control their diet and manage weight. However, such products are not suitable for people with special medical conditions that may require targeted dietary as well as motivational support. The paper presents a user centered approach of developing a Mobile Web App that focuses on breast cancer patients looking at their specific dietary, physical and mental requirements depending on the stage of their medical treatment. The paper explores the effect of incorporating gamification and social media as motivational drive to engage and motivate people to achieve their goals of adopting healthier eating habits while increasing physical activity in order ensure lasting lifestyle behavioural change. The design of PhytoCloud is being described, a gamified Mobile Web App that enables users to record their dietary habits and physical activity and motivate their consumption of food with oestrogen-like properties (phytoestrogens) which are linked to the prevention of reappearance of breast cancer. The paper concludes with a discussion of future directions and adaptations to the current design to suite a Mobile Native Application design.

46	ESM_2	The development of a mobile monitoring and feedback tool to stimulate physical activity of people with a chronic disease in primary care: A user-centered design	Background: Physical activity is an important aspect in the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or type-2 diabetes. A monitoring and feedback tool combined with guidance by a primary care provider might be a successful method to enhance the level of physical activity in these patients. As a prerequisite for useful technology, it is important to involve the end-users in the design process from an early stage. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the user requirements for a tool to stimulate physical activity, embedded in primary care practice. The leading principle of this tool is to change behavior by self-monitoring, goal-setting, and feedback. Methods: The research team collected qualitative data among 15 patients, 16 care professionals, and several experts. A prototype was developed in three stages. In stage 1, the literature was searched to identify end-users and context. In stage 2, the literature, experts and patient representatives were consulted to set up a use case with the general idea of the innovation. In stage 3, individual interviews and focus groups were held to identify the end-user requirements. Based on these requirements a prototype was built by the engineering team. Results: The development process has led to a tool that generally meets the requirements of the end-users. A tri-axial activity sensor, worn on the hip, is connected by Bluetooth to a smartphone. In an app, quantitative feedback is given about the amount of activity and goals reached by means of graphical visualization, and an image shows a sun when the goal is reached. Overviews about activity per half an hour, per day, week, and month are provided. In the menu of the app and on a secured website, patients can enter information in individual sessions or read feedback messages generated by the system. The practice nurse can see the results of all patients on a secure webpage and can then discuss the results and set personalized goals in consultation with the patient. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a user-centered approach brings in valuable details (such as the requirements for feedback in activity minutes per day) to improve the fit between the user, technology, and the organization of care, which is important for the usability and acceptability of the tool. The tool embedded in primary care will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.

In stage 3, individual interviews and focus groups were held to identify the end-user requirements. Based on these requirements a prototype was built by the engineering team. Results: The development process has led to a tool that generally meets the requirements of the end-users. A tri-axial activity sensor, worn on the hip, is connected by Bluetooth to a smartphone. In an app, quantitative feedback is given about the amount of activity and goals reached by means of graphical visualization, and an image shows a sun when the goal is reached. Overviews about activity per half an hour, per day, week, and month are provided. In the menu of the app and on a secured website, patients can enter information in individual sessions or read feedback messages generated by the system. The practice nurse can see the results of all patients on a secure webpage and can then discuss the results and set personalized goals in consultation with the patient. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a user-centered approach brings in valuable details (such as the requirements for feedback in activity minutes per day) to improve the fit between the user, technology, and the organization of care, which is important for the usability and acceptability of the tool. The tool embedded in primary care will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. (c) 2013 JMIR Publications. All rights reserved."",

In this study the usability of the tool was evaluated by technology experts and end users (people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or type 2 diabetes, with ages from 40-70 years), to improve the user interfaces and content of the tool. Patients and methods: The study had four phases: 1) a heuristic evaluation with six technology experts; 2) a usability test in a laboratory by five patients; 3) a pilot in real life wherein 20 patients used the tool for 3 months; and 4) a final lab test by five patients. In both lab tests (phases 2 and 4) qualitative data were collected through a thinking-aloud procedure and video recordings, and quantitative data through questions about task complexity, text comprehensiveness, and readability. In addition, the post-study system usability questionnaire (PSSUQ) was completed for the app and the website. In the pilot test (phase 3), all patients were interviewed three times and the Software Usability Measurement Inventory (SUMI) was completed. Results: After each phase, improvements were made, mainly to the layout and text. The main improvement was a refresh button for active data synchronization between activity sensor, app, and server, implemented after connectivity problems in the pilot test. The mean score on the PSSUQ for the website improved from 5.6 (standard deviation [SD] 1.3) to 6.5 (SD 0.5), and for the app from 5.4 (SD 1.5) to 6.2 (SD 1.1). Satisfaction in the pilot was not very high according to the SUMI. Discussion: The use of laboratory versus real-life tests and expert-based versus user-based tests revealed a wide range of usability issues. The usability of the It's LiFe! tool improved considerably during the study.	adult; aged; article; biosensor; chronic obstructive lung disease; client server application; clinical article; computer interface; computer program; feedback system; female; human; male; mobile phone; monitoring; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient satisfaction; physical activity; pilot study	van der Weegen, Sanne; Verwey, Renee; Tange, Huibert J.; Spreeuwenberg, Marieke D.; de Witte, Luc P.

48	ESM_2	Designing icanfit: A mobile-enabled web application to promote physical activity for older cancer survivors	Background: Most older cancer survivors (OCS) do not engage in regular physical activity (PA) despite well-known health benefits. With the increased use of mobile technologies among older adults, mobile tools may be an effective method to deliver PA promotion programs for OCS. Objective: To document the process of designing an OCS-friendly mobile-enabled Web application of PA promotion program. Methods: Mixed methods encompassing group discussions, individual interviews, and brief surveys with community leaders, OCS, cancer care providers, and software professionals were used in this formative research. Results: The varied stakeholders welcomed the idea of developing an online tool to promote PA in OCS. Our formative research revealed several major barriers to regular PA including limited access to senior-friendly PA resources, lack of motivation and social support, and insufficient knowledge and skills on building safe and appropriate workout plans. This feedback was incorporated into the development of iCanFit, a mobile-enabled Web application, designed specifically for OCS. The iCanFit online tools allow users to locate PA resources, set and track goals for PA, network with peer OCS in a secure online space, and receive practical and evidence-informed healthy tips. Conclusions: Our mixed-method formative research led to the design of iCanFit protocol to promote PA and well-being of OCS. The involvement of stakeholders is critical in the planning and design of the mobile application in order to enhance program relevance, appeal, and match with the needs of target users.

49	ESM_2	Usage of an exercise app in the care for people with osteoarthritis: User-driven exploratory study	Background: Exercise has proven to reduce pain and increase quality of life among people living with osteoarthritis (OA). However, one major challenge is adherence to exercise once supervision ends. Objective: This study aimed to identify mental and physical barriers and motivational and social aspects of training at home, and to test or further develop an exercise app. Methods: The study was inspired from participatory design, engaging users in the research process. Data were collected through focus groups and workshops, and analyzed by systematic text condensation. Results: Three main themes were found: competition as motivation, training together, and barriers. The results revealed that the participants wanted to do their training and had knowledge on exercise and pain but found it hard to motivate themselves. They missed the observation, comments, and encouragement by the supervising physiotherapist as well as their peers. Ways to optimize the training app were identified during the workshops as participants shared their experience. Conclusions: This study concludes that the long-term continuation of exercising for patients with OA could be improved with the use of a technology tailored to users' needs, including motivational and other behavioral factors.

50	ESM_2	Supporting cancer patients in illness management: Usability evaluation of a mobile app	Background: Mobile phones and tablets currently represent a significant presence in people's everyday lives. They enable access to different information and services independent of current place and time. Such widespread connectivity offers significant potential in different app areas including health care. Objective: Our goal was to evaluate the usability of the Connect Mobile app. The mobile app enables mobile access to the Connect system, an online system that supports cancer patients in managing health-related issues. Along with symptom management, the system promotes better patient-provider communication, collaboration, and shared decision making. The Connect Mobile app enables access to the Connect system over both mobile phones and tablets. Methods: The study consisted of usability tests of a high fidelity prototype with 7 cancer patients where the objectives were to identify existing design and functionality issues and to provide patients with a real look-and-feel of the mobile system. In addition, we conducted semistructured interviews to obtain participants' feedback about app usefulness, identify the need for new system features and design requirements, and measure the acceptance of the mobile app and its features within everyday health management. Results: The study revealed a total of 27 design issues (13 for mobile apps and 14 for tablet apps), which were mapped to source events (ie, errors, requests for help, participants' concurrent feedback, and moderator observation). We also applied usability heuristics to identify violations of usability principles. The majority of violations were related to enabling ease of input, screen readability, and glanceability (15 issues), as well as supporting an appropriate match between systems and the real world (7 issues) and consistent mapping of system functions and interactions (4 issues). Feedback from participants also showed the cancer patients' requirements for support systems and how these needs are influenced by different context-related factors, such as type of access terminal (eg, desktop computer, tablet, mobile phone) and phases of illness. Based on the observed results, we proposed design and functionality recommendations that can be used for the development of mobile apps for cancer patients to support their health management process. Conclusions: Understanding and addressing users' requirements is one of the main prerequisites for developing useful and effective technology-based health interventions. The results of this study outline different user requirements related to the design of the mobile patient support app for cancer patients. The results will be used in the iterative development of the Connect Mobile app and can also inform other developers and researchers in development, integration, and evaluation of mobile health apps and services that support cancer patients in managing their health-related issues.

51	ESM_2	Vision: Mobile ehealth learning and intervention platform	Face-to-face health educational and intervention programs are helpful in addressing mental and physical illness challenges in focused groups. However, these programs are expensive, resource-intensive and struggle with scalability and reachability, leading to limited take-up and short-term impact. Digital Health Intervention (DHI) programs incorporate the use of technology - mobile, web, wearables, virtual and augmented reality - to address these limitations while being more cost-effective. DHIs have shown major success in improving physical and mental health outcomes for the general public as well as reducing adverse outcomes or high-risk groups. However, it is still very challenging and expensive to design and run high quality mobile-based DHI programs, in part due to the lack of technical skills of researchers in this field. Our proposed mobile eHealth Learning and Intervention Platform (eHeLP) aims to address these challenges with a novel approach that allows health researchers to focus on their studies, and participants to have access to multiple health programs that meet their needs.

    abstract = ""Face-to-face health educational and intervention programs are helpful in addressing mental and physical illness challenges in focused groups. However, these programs are expensive, resource-intensive and struggle with scalability and reachability, leading to limited take-up and short-term impact. Digital Health Intervention (DHI) programs incorporate the use of technology - mobile, web, wearables, virtual and augmented reality - to address these limitations while being more cost-effective. DHIs have shown major success in improving physical and mental health outcomes for the general public as well as reducing adverse outcomes or high-risk groups. However, it is still very challenging and expensive to design and run high quality mobile-based DHI programs, in part due to the lack of technical skills of researchers in this field. Our proposed mobile eHealth Learning and Intervention Platform (eHeLP) aims to address these challenges with a novel approach that allows health researchers to focus on their studies, and participants to have access to multiple health programs that meet their needs. The platform caters for identified stakeholders in the DHI field and encourages the development of a new health-tech industry. We present our vision eHeLP, why this idea is worth further research, risks we perceive, and next steps. (c) 2018 ACM."",

52	ESM_2	Toward gamified pain management apps: mobile application rating scale|based quality assessment of pain-mentor=s first prototype through an expert study	Background: The use of health apps to support the treatment of chronic pain is gaining importance. Most available pain management apps are still lacking in content quality and quantity as their developers neither involve health experts to ensure target group suitability nor use gamification to engage and motivate the user. To close this gap, we aimed to develop a gamified pain management app, Pain-Mentor. Objective: To determine whether medical professionals would approve of Pain-Mentor's concept and content, this study aimed to evaluate the quality of the app's first prototype with experts from the field of chronic pain management and to discover necessary improvements. Methods: A total of 11 health professionals with a background in chronic pain treatment and 2 mobile health experts participated in this study. Each expert first received a detailed presentation of the app. Afterward, they tested Pain-Mentor and then rated its quality using the mobile application rating scale (MARS) in a semistructured interview. Results: The experts found the app to be of excellent general (mean 4.54, SD 0.55) and subjective quality (mean 4.57, SD 0.43). The app-specific section was rated as good (mean 4.38, SD 0.75). Overall, the experts approved of the app's content, namely, pain and stress management techniques, behavior change techniques, and gamification. They believed that the use of gamification in Pain-Mentor positively influences the patients' motivation and engagement and thus has the potential to promote the learning of pain management techniques. Moreover, applying the MARS in a semistructured interview provided in-depth insight into the ratings and concrete suggestions for improvement. Conclusions: The experts rated Pain-Mentor to be of excellent quality. It can be concluded that experts perceived the use of gamification in this pain management app in a positive manner. This showed that combining pain management with gamification did not negatively affect the app's integrity. This study was therefore a promising first step in the development of Pain-Mentor.

54	ESM_2	Interactive Health Communication Applications for people with chronic disease	Background:Interactive Health Communication Applications (IHCAs) are computer-based, usually web-based, information packages for patients that combine health information with at least one of social support, decision support, or behaviour change support. These are innovations in health care and their effects on health are uncertain.Objectives:To assess the effects of IHCAs for people with chronic disease.Search strategy:We designed a four-part search strategy. First, we searched electronic bibliographic databases for published work; second, we searched the grey literature; and third, we searched for ongoing and recently completed clinical trials in the appropriate databases. Finally, researchers of included studies were contacted, and reference lists from relevant primary and review articles were followed up. As IHCAs require relatively new technology, the search time period commenced at 1990, where possible, and ran until 31 December 2003.Selection criteria:Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of IHCAs for adults and children with chronic disease.Data collection and analysis:One reviewer screened abstracts for relevance. Two reviewers screened all candidate studies to determine eligibility, apply quality criteria, and extract data from included studies. Authors of included RCTs were contacted for missing data. Results of RCTs were pooled using random-effects model with standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios for binary outcomes; heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2 )statistic.Main results:We identified 24 RCTs involving 3739 participants which were included in the review.IHCAs had a significant positive effect on knowledge (SMD 0.46; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.69), social support (SMD 0.35; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.52) and clinical outcomes (SMD 0.18; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.35). Results suggest it is more likely than not that IHCAs have a positive effect on self-efficacy (a person's belief in their capacity to carry out a specific action) (SMD 0.24; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.48). IHCAs had a significant positive effect on continuous behavioural outcomes (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.40). Binary behavioural outcomes also showed a positive effect for IHCAs, although this result was not statistically significant (OR 1.66; 95% CI 0.71 to 3.87). It was not possible to determine the effects of IHCAs on emotional or economic outcomes.Authors' conclusions:IHCAs appear to have largely positive effects on users, in that users tend to become more knowledgeable, feel better socially supported, and may have improved behavioural and clinical outcomes compared to non-users. There is a need for more high quality studies with large sample sizes to confirm these preliminary findings, to determine the best type and best way to deliver IHCAs, and to establish how IHCAs have their effects for different groups of people with chronic illness.

55	ESM_2	Incorporating behavioral trigger messages into a mobile health app for chronic disease management: Randomized clinical feasibility trial in diabetes	Background: Although there is a rise in the use of mobile health (mHealth) tools to support chronic disease management, evidence derived from theory-driven design is lacking. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the impact of an mHealth app that incorporated theory-driven trigger messages. These messages took different forms following the Fogg behavior model (FBM) and targeted self-efficacy, knowledge, and self-care. We assess the feasibility of our app in modifying these behaviors in a pilot study involving individuals with diabetes. Methods: The pilot randomized unblinded study comprised two cohorts recruited as employees from within a health care system. In total, 20 patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited for the study and a within-subjects design was utilized. Each participant interacted with an app called capABILITY. capABILITY and its affiliated trigger (text) messages integrate components from social cognitive theory (SCT), FBM, and persuasive technology into the interactive health communications framework. In this within-subjects design, participants interacted with the capABILITY app and received (or did not receive) text messages in alternative blocks. The capABILITY app alone was the control condition along with trigger messages including spark and facilitator messages. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare adherence with behavioral measures and engagement with the mobile app across conditions. A paired sample t test was utilized on each health outcome to determine changes related to capABILITY intervention, as well as participants' classified usage of capABILITY. Results: Pre- and postintervention results indicated statistical significance on 3 of the 7 health survey measures (general diet: P=.03; exercise: P=.005; and blood glucose: P=.02). When only analyzing the high and midusers (n=14) of capABILITY, we found a statistically significant difference in both self-efficacy (P=.008) and exercise (P=.01). Although the ANOVA did not reveal any statistically significant differences across groups, there is a trend among spark conditions to respond more quickly (ie, shorter log-in lag) following the receipt of the message. Conclusions: Our theory-driven mHealth app appears to be a feasible means of improving self-efficacy and health-related behaviors. Although our sample size is too small to draw conclusions about the differential impact of specific forms of trigger messages, our findings suggest that spark triggers may have the ability to cue engagement in mobile tools. This was demonstrated with the increased use of capABILITY at the beginning and conclusion of the study depending on spark timing. Our results suggest that theory-driven personalization of mobile tools is a viable form of intervention.

56	ESM_2	Type I diabetes self-management: Developing a web-based telemedicine application	Background: Self-management skills are essential for patients with diabetes mellitus to minimise the risks of complications from their condition. The aim of this research was to develop a web-based application for self-management of type 1 diabetes, suitable for use by patients, their carers and physicians. Method: The study was comprised of two phases, the first being analysis of the kind of information and capabilities required by potential users of the system. Based on the results derived from the first phase of the study, the system prototype was designed and then evaluated using the 'think aloud' method and a standard questionnaire. The application was designed for use by patients, their carers and physicians. Patients could enter the level of blood glucose, insulin and activities on a daily basis, and physicians were able to supervise a patient's health status from a distance. Results: Users were generally satisfied with the final version of the system. People with a wide range of literacy skills were able to use the system effectively. Conclusion: Patients or their carers could use the web-based application as a log book by entering the level of blood glucose and insulin doses on a regular basis, and as an educational resource to improve self-management skills. Physicians could use the system at any time convenient to them to support patients by giving medical advice. Further research is needed to report the effectiveness of the system in practice.

57	ESM_2	Effectiveness of a Web-based tailored interactive health communication application for patients with type 2 diabetes or chronic low back pain: Randomized controlled trial	Background: The prevalence of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and chronic low back pain is rising. Patient empowerment is a key strategy in the management of chronic diseases. Patient empowerment can be fostered by Web-based interactive health communication applications (IHCAs) that combine health information with decision support, social support, and/or behavioral change support. Tailoring the content and tone of IHCAs to the needs of individual patients might improve their effectiveness. Objective: The main objective was to test the effectiveness of a Web-based, tailored, fully automated IHCA for patients with type 2 diabetes or chronic low back pain against a standard website with identical content without tailoring (control condition) on patients' knowledge and empowerment. Methods: We performed a blinded randomized trial with a parallel design. In the intervention group, the content was delivered in dialogue form, tailored to relevant patient characteristics. In the control group, the sections of the text were presented in a content tree without any tailoring. Participants were recruited online and offline and were blinded to their group assignments. Measurements were taken at baseline (t0), directly after the first visit (t1), and at 3-month follow-up (t2). The primary hypothesis was that the tailored IHCA would have larger effects on knowledge and patient empowerment (primary outcomes) than the control website. The secondary outcomes were decisional conflict and preparation for decision making. All measurements were conducted by online self-report questionnaires. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and available cases (AC) analyses were performed for all outcomes. Results: A total of 561 users agreed to participate in the study. Of these, 179 (31.9%) had type 2 diabetes and 382 (68.1%) had chronic low back pain. Usage was significantly higher in the tailored system (mean 51.2 minutes) than in the control system (mean 37.6 minutes; P<.001). Three months after system use, 52.4% of the sample was retained. There was no significant intervention effect in the ITT analysis. In the AC analysis, participants using the tailored system displayed significantly more knowledge at t1 (P=.02) and more emotional well-being (subscale of empowerment) at t2 (P=.009). The estimated mean difference between the groups was 3.9 (95% CI 0.5-7.3) points for knowledge and 25.4 (95% CI 6.3-44.5) points for emotional well-being on a 0-100 points scale. Conclusions: The primary analysis did not support the study hypothesis. However, content tailoring and interactivity may increase knowledge and reduce health-related negative effects in persons who use IHCAs. There were no main effects of the intervention on other dimensions of patient empowerment or decision-related outcomes. This might be due to our tailored IHCA being, at its core, an educational intervention offering health information in a personalized, empathic fashion that merely additionally provides decision support. Tailoring and interactivity may not make a difference with regard to these outcomes.Trial Registration: International Clinical Trials Registry: DRKS00003322; http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=DRKS00003322 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6WPO0lJwE).

58	ESM_2	Health information, behavior change, and decision support for patients with type 2 diabetes: Development of a tailored, preference-sensitive health communication application	Patient involvement in diabetes treatment such as shared decision-making and patient self-management has significant effects on clinical parameters. As a prerequisite for active involvement, patients need to be informed in an adequate and preference-sensitive way. Interactive Health Communication Applications (IHCAs) that combine web-based health information for patients with additional support offer the opportunity to reach great numbers of patients at low cost and provide them with high-quality information and support at the time, place, and learning speed they prefer. Still, web-based interventions often suffer from high attrition. Tailoring the intervention to patients' needs and preferences might reduce attrition and should thereby increase effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to develop a tailored IHCA offering evidence-based, preference-sensitive content and treatment decision support to patients with type 2 diabetes. The content was developed based on a needs assessment and two evidence-based treatment guidelines. The delivery format is a dialogue-based, tunneled design tailoring the content and tone of the dialogue to relevant patient characteristics (health literacy, attitudes toward self-care, and psychological barriers to insulin treatment). Both content and tailoring were revised by an interdisciplinary advisory committee. Conclusion: The World Wide Web holds great potential for patient information and self-management interventions. With the development and evaluation of a tailored IHCA, we complement face-to-face consultations of patients with their health care practitioners and make them more efficient and satisfying for both sides. Effects of the application are currently being tested within a randomized controlled trial.	insulin; application service provider; article; attitude to health; behavior change; clinical effectiveness; consultation; decision support system; diabetes control; diabetes education; evidence based medicine; fear; feedback system; health literacy; human; Internet; medical information; needs assessment; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; outcome assessment; patient education; patient information; patient satisfaction; personalized medicine; practice guideline; process development; questionnaire; self care; semi structured interview; social stigma	Weymann, Nina; Harter, Martin; Petrak, Frank; Dirmaier, Jorg	Patient Preference and Adherence	https://doi.org/10.2147/PPA.S46924		1091 - 1099	"""@ARTICLE{Weymann20131091,

59	ESM_2	A tailored, dialogue-based health communication application for patients with chronic low back pain: Study protocol of a randomised controlled trial	Background: Chronic low back pain is a common chronic condition whose treatment success can be improved by active involvement of patients. Patient involvement can be fostered by web-based applications combining health information with decision support or behaviour change support. These so-called Interactive Health Communication Applications (IHCAs) can reach great numbers of patients at low financial cost and provide information and support at the time, place and learning speed patients prefer. However, high attrition often seems to decrease the effects of web-based interventions. Tailoring content and tone of IHCAs to the individual patient s needs might improve usage and therefore effectiveness. This study aims to evaluate a tailored IHCA for people with chronic low back pain combining health information with decision support and behaviour change support. Methods/Design. The tailored IHCA will be tested regarding effectiveness and usage against a standard website with identical content in a single-blinded randomized trial with a parallel design. The IHCA contains information on chronic low back pain and its treatment options including health behaviour change recommendations. In the intervention group the content is delivered in dialogue form, tailored to relevant patient characteristics (health literacy, coping style). In the control group there is no tailoring, a standard web-page is used for presenting the content. Participants are unaware of group assignment. Eligibility criteria are age >= 18 years, self- reported chronic low back pain, and Internet access. To detect the expected small effect (Cohen's d = 0.2), the sample aims to include 414 patients, with assessments at baseline, directly after the first on-page visit, and at 3-month follow-up using online self-report questionnaires. It is expected that the tailored IHCA has larger effects on knowledge and patient empowerment (primary outcomes) compared to a standard website. Secondary outcomes are website usage, preparation for decision making, and decisional conflict. Discussion. IHCAs can be a suitable way to promote knowledge about chronic low back pain and self-management competencies. Results of the study can increase the knowledge on how to develop IHCAs which are more useful and effective for people suffering from chronic low back pain. Trial registration.

60	ESM_2	MomMoodBooster web-based intervention for postpartum depression: Feasibility trial results	Background: Postpartum depression (PPD)-the most common complication of childbirth-is a significant and prevalent public health problem that severely disrupts family interactions and can result in serious lasting consequences to the health of women and the healthy development of infants. These consequences increase in severity when left untreated; most women with PPD do not obtain help due to a range of logistical and attitudinal barriers. Objective: This pilot study was designed to test the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of an innovative and interactive guided Web-based intervention for postpartum depression, MomMoodBooster (MMB). Methods: A sample of 53 women who satisfied eligibility criteria (<9 months postpartum, =18 years of age, home Internet access and use of personal email, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Survey score of 12-20 or Patient Health Questionnaire score from 10-19) were invited to use the MMB program. Assessments occurred at screening/pretest, posttest (3 months following enrollment), and at 6 months follow-up. Results: All six sessions of the program were completed by 87% (46/53) of participants. Participants were engaged with the program: visit days (mean 15.2, SD 8.7), number of visits (mean 20.1, SD 12.2), total duration of visits in hours (mean 5.1, SD 1.3), and number of sessions viewed out of six (mean 5.6, SD 1.3) all support high usage. Posttest data were collected from 89% of participants (47/53) and 6-month follow-up data were collected from 87% of participants (46/53). At pretest, 55% (29/53) of participants met PHQ-9 criteria for minor or major depression. At posttest, 90% (26/29) no longer met criteria. Conclusions: These findings support the expanded use and additional testing of the MMB program, including its implementation in a range of clinical and public health settings.

61	ESM_2	Adapting an in-person patient-caregiver communication intervention to a tailored web-based format	Background: Interventions that target cancer patients and their caregivers have been shown to improve patient-caregiver communication, support, and emotional well-being. Objective: To adapt an in-person communication intervention for cancer patients and caregivers to a web-based format, and to examine the usability and acceptability of the web-based program among representative users. Methods: A tailored, interactive web-based communication program for cancer patients and their family caregivers was developed based on an existing in-person, nurse-delivered intervention. The development process involved: (1) building a multidisciplinary team of content and web design experts, (2) combining key components of the in-person intervention with the unique tailoring and interactive features of a web-based platform, and (3) conducting focus groups and usability testing to obtain feedback from representative program users at multiple time points. Results: Four focus groups with 2-3 patient-caregiver pairs per group (n = 22 total participants) and two iterations of usability testing with four patient-caregiver pairs per session (n = 16 total participants) were conducted. Response to the program's structure, design, and content was favorable, even among users who were older or had limited computer and Internet experience. The program received high ratings for ease of use and overall usability (mean System Usability Score of 89.5 out of 100). Conclusions: Many elements of a nurse-delivered patient-caregiver intervention can be successfully adapted to a web-based format. A multidisciplinary design team and an iterative evaluation process with representative users were instrumental in the development of a usable and well-received web-based program.

62	ESM_2	Coping with cancer: A web-based educational program for early and middle adolescents	"Educating patients is a primary responsibility of all nurses; however, because of time constraints and staff shortages, pediatric oncology nurses are often unable to adequately prepare patients for cancer treatment. Instead, patients frequently rely on the Internet as a source of information about cancer, some of which can be outdated and inaccurate. Adolescents regard the Internet as a valuable source of health information as it is easily accessible, less threatening, and confidential. Considering the need for accurate, readily available information for adolescents with cancer, the purpose of this study was to develop and validate an innovative, interactive Web-based educational program to prepare early and middle adolescents for cancer treatment. Titled ""Coping With Cancer,"" this program was developed by the investigator after conducting in-depth interviews of adolescent cancer survivors and their parents. Based on the transactional model of coping, the program focuses on enhancing the adolescent's knowledge of cancer, cancer treatment, and healthy coping strategies. Coping With Cancer can be an effective resource for pediatric oncology nurses in providing ongoing education for adolescents with cancer."

63	ESM_2	A Tailored Web-Based Psycho-Educational Intervention for Cancer Patients and Their Family Caregivers	BACKGROUND:: Most programs addressing psychosocial concerns of cancer survivors are in-person programs that are expensive to deliver, have limited availability, and seldom deal with caregivers’ concerns. OBJECTIVE:: This study examined the feasibility of translating an efficacious nurse-delivered program (FOCUS Program) for patients and their caregivers to a tailored, dyadic Web-based format. Specific aims were to (1) test the preliminary effects of the Web-based intervention on patient and caregiver outcomes, (2) examine participants’ program satisfaction, and (3) determine the feasibility of using a Web-based delivery format. METHODS:: A phase 2 feasibility study was conducted with cancer patients (lung, breast, colorectal, prostate) and their family caregivers (N = 38 dyads). The Web-based intervention provided information and support tailored to the unique characteristics of each patient, caregiver, and their dyadic relationship. Primary outcomes were emotional distress and quality of life. Secondary outcomes were benefits of illness/caregiving, communication, support, and self-efficacy. Analyses included descriptive statistics and repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS:: Dyads had a significant decrease in emotional distress, increase in quality of life, and perceived more benefits of illness/caregiving. Caregivers also had significant improvement in self-efficacy. There were no changes in communication. Participants were satisfied with program usability, but recommended additional content. CONCLUSIONS:: It was possible to translate a clinician-delivered program to a Web-based format that was easy to use and had positive effects on dyadic outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:: The Web-based program is a promising way to provide psychosocial care to more patients and caregivers using fewer personnel. It needs further testing in a larger randomized clinical trial. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.,” vol. 37, no. 5, pp. 321–330, 2014, doi: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000159.		L.

64	ESM_2	Use of a Smartphone Application to Reduce Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes: A Pilot Study	"Background: Hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia unawareness are common in long-standing type 1 diabetes (T1D). This pilot study examined the real-world use of a smartphone application (app), which receives meter readings and logs hypoglycemic symptoms, causes, and treatments to reduce hypoglycemia. Methods: Adults with T1D and recent hypoglycemia synchronized their glucose meter to their smartphone and used the Joslin HypoMap(tm) app powered by Glooko to track hypoglycemic events. At baseline, and after 6 and 12 weeks of using the app, a blinded continuous glucose monitor (CGM; Dexcom G4) was used for 2 weeks and surveys administered. Results: Participants (n = 22) at baseline had mean (SD) age 43 (14) years, duration of diabetes 26 (13) years, A1c 8.0% (0.87) and 21/22 had reduced hypoglycemia awareness per Clarke Hypoglycemia Unawareness survey scores; 13 (59%) were ""CGM completers"" (CGM data available at baseline and follow-up). Most noncompletion related to time required/difficulties using the mobile app. After 6 weeks, 8/13 completers (62% of CGM completers, 36% of total participants) had reduced daytime minutes with glucose <54 mg/dL (mean |331 minutes) and 10/13 (77% of CGM completers; 45% of total participants) had reduced time <= 70 mg/dL (mean |449 minutes). This was not sustained at 12 weeks, at which time half of the completers had less time (""improved""). Five participants reported improved hypoglycemia awareness; 9 stated the app helped them better recognize hypoglycemia. Conclusions: Use of this phone app has the potential to help reduce daytime hypoglycemia in a subset of T1D adults with reduce hypoglycemia awareness; larger studies are needed."

65	ESM_2	Pain buddy: A novel use of m-health in the management of children's cancer pain	Background Over 12,000 children are diagnosed with cancer every year in the United States. In addition to symptoms associated with their disease, children undergoing chemotherapy frequently experience significant pain, which is unfortunately often undertreated. The field of m-Health offers an innovative avenue for pain assessment and intervention in the home setting. The current study describes the development and initial evaluation of a tablet-based program, Pain Buddy, aimed to enhance pain management and foster improved quality of life in children ages 8–18 years undergoing cancer treatment. Methods An animated avatar-based tablet application was developed using state-of-the-art software. Key aspects of Pain Buddy include daily pain and symptom diaries completed by children, remote monitoring of symptoms by uploading patient’s data through internet to a cloud server, cognitive and behavioral skills training, interactive three-dimensional avatars that guide children through the program, and an incentive system to motivate engagement. Twelve children between the ages of 8 and 18 participated in a pilot study of Pain Buddy. Results Children were highly satisfied with the program. Pain and appetite disturbances were most frequently endorsed. Symptom trigger alerts to outside providers were largely related to clinically significant pain. Children infrequently used analgesics, and reported using some non-pharmacological pain management strategies. Conclusion Pain Buddy appears to be a promising tool to improve pain and symptom management in children undergoing cancer treatment. Results from the current study will inform future improvements to Pain Buddy, in preparation for a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of this innovative treatment.,” vol. 76, pp. 202–214, 2016, doi: 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.07.012.

66	ESM_2	Non-verbal Persuasion and Communication in an Affective Agent	"This chapter deals with the communication of persuasion. Only a small percentage of communication involves words: as the old saying goes, ""it's not what you say, it's how you say it"". While this likely underestimates the importance of good verbal persuasion techniques, it is accurate in underlining the critical role of non-verbal behaviour during face-to-face communication. In this chapter we restrict the discussion to body language. We also consider embodied virtual agents. As is the case with humans, there are a number of fundamental factors to be considered when constructing persuasive agents. In particular, one who wishes to persuade must appear credible, trustworthy, confident, and non-threatening. Knowing how not to behave is also a vital basis for effective persuasion. This includes resolving task constraints or other factors with the social perception considerations. These social virtual agents face many of the same problems as humans have in controlling and expressing themselves in an appropriate manner so as to establish and maintain persuasive interaction. All along the chapter, much of our discussion will handle concepts applicable both to agent and to human behaviour."

69	ESM_2	Assist-Me, a volunteer mobile emergency system to assist elderly people	Assisting elderly people in emergency situations is very important to improve their quality of life. This assistance can be done with the help of volunteers using technology and in particular pervasive and mobile computing. We propose in this paper Assist-Me, a smart system aimed at assisting elderly people in case of emergency. The goal is to enhance elderly people daily life independence and autonomy, in indoor and outdoor environments, by offering flexible and faster assistance in emergency situations via social intervention offered by volunteers. We believe that our solution can alleviate the unnecessary intervention of emergency center, provide a flexible volunteering intervention and better serve elderly people in needs. Assist-Me includes two smartphone applications: one for elderly people that require emergency assistance and the second for volunteers who receive the request. Assist-Me manages emergency situations by automatically selecting appropriate volunteers based on fuzzy-logic engine. The implementation of the engine is also presented in this paper.

71	ESM_2	MyUI: Generating accessible user interfaces from multimodal design patterns	Adaptive user interfaces can make technology more accessible. Quite a number of conceptual and technical approaches have been proposed for adaptations to diverse user needs, multiple devices or multiple environments. Little work, however, has been directed at integrating all the essential aspects of adaptive user interfaces for accessibility in one system. In this paper, we present our generic MyUI infrastructure for increased accessibility through automatically generated adaptive user interfaces.

74	ESM_2	Developing a Multimodal Interface for the Elderly	The elderly remain excluded from technology, since they regard traditional computer interfaces as overly technical and difficult to use. However, the older users consider other forms of interaction easier to use - like touch and gesture recognition interfaces. Regarding the touch interfaces, we focused on text-entry tasks and developed and tested 5 virtual QWERTY keyboard variants in order to improve text entry speed and accuracy on tablet devices. Preliminary user tests with young adults revealed that soft keyboards without visual changes remain the fastest method for text entry, and allowed us to rule out the least promising variants. Regarding gesture recognition, we developed regular gestures as well as alternative functionalities based on the motion sensing device: user and ambient sensing. These features allow to create a more intelligent system that reacts to the user and environment without explicit interaction. In the near future, we will perform tests for both interaction modalities with older adults.	Multimodal interfaces; elderly; multi-touch tablets; body gestures; text-entry performance	É.

76	ESM_2	Multimodal Interface for Elderly People	"With the continuous ageing of the population, the demand for different healthcare services is increasing at a fast pace. At the same time, the number of caregivers is limited and the cost of well-being is increasing. Therefore, there is a recognized need for technologies that assist elderly people in their daily activities and ensure their safety along with their social integration while maintaining a higher degree of independence. One important aspect in the development of such technologies is their easy acceptance by elderly users. Traditional human-machine interfaces have always represented a barrier for the acceptance of new devices by non-technical people in general and by elderly or people with special needs in particular. In this paper, we propose a multimodal interface designed to match the requirements of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems and to fulfill the needs of elderly people who are the main users of this interface. The interface is multilingual, it supports two languages (English and Romanian) and it can process both speech and gesture commands. The interface is developed using HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3 and integrates Google Speech Service along with other services. It is able to adapt itself to any screen size and to work flawlessly across different platforms. The interface was developed and tested within the ""Artificial intelligent ecosystem for self-management and sustainable quality of life in AAL"" (CAMI) project. Both the interface and the results of laboratory tests are presented in this paper."

77	ESM_2	Reducing Cognitive Impairment Among Dementia Users Through Mobile Application	Cognitive impairment includes the lacking ability to remember things, disorientation in remembering the current location, and the struggle to find the correct word. People with dementia (PwD) are often involved in this impairment. With that being said, this project proposes the use of a mobile application to help in improving their cognitive issues. To tackle this problem, features and functionality of a mobile application specifically for dementia users are identified which contributes to the development of a diary application. Identifying and gathering features from previous studies was the initial method. Development of the diary application followed the software development life cycle (SDLC) waterfall method and evaluation of the application was experimented with identified dementia users. The findings of this project are the application set of guidelines gathered from literature into the diary application. Four verified dementia people were involved in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the application. The evaluation of the application includes some good points. Some parts of the application are pointed out for their unsuitable design and suggestions are given to improve the application in the later future.	nan	N. A. M. Hassan; A. Baharum; Z. H. A. Sani; K.

78	ESM_2	Phone Row: A Smartphone Game Designed to Persuade People to Engage in Moderate-Intensity Physical Activity	Few people reach the recommended levels of moderate-intensity physical activity (MIPA). This study examines whether persuasive technology, in the form of a smartphone game, can help people engage more in MIPA. A smartphone boat racing game was developed that requires users to make rowing movements and therefore engage in MIPA to play it successfully. With these rowing movements, users can control the movement of a virtual boat across a virtual track on an external screen. Users were fond of the concept of the game. However, a sub-optimal implementation resulted in users not wanting to replay the game and thus not developing a habit involving performance of MIPA. The implementation of the concept was inadequate for testing the hypothesis that a smartphone game can help people engage more in MIPA.	moderate-intensity physical activity; exercise; smartphone game; persuasive technology; exergaming	Matthijs Jan Zwinderman; Azadeh Shirzad; Xinyu Ma; Prina Bajracharya; Hans Sandberg; Maurits Clemens Kaptein	International Conference on Persuasive Technology	https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-31037-9_5		pp 55-66		Included	Excluded	snowballing		not have adaptive user interface	2	Springer Link		Phone row: A smartphone game designed to persuade people to engage in moderate-intensity physical activity	https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-31037-9_5	Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; Link
79	ESM_2	Improving adolescent fitness attitudes with a mobile fitness game to combat obesity in youth	We present the tests results of the first phase of a multi-phase study to combat deteriorating adolescent fitness, reflected in the growth in adolescent obesity rates, by creating a fitness game deployed on mobile devices. The objective of this first phase was to test an initial mobile fitness prototype's efficacy in generating positive attitudinal changes towards fitness activity using strong socialization components within the game. The basic premise being that game play with a strong social aspect is an attractive support mechanism for sustained interest and providing positive reinforcement to users within our fitness application. Such sustained interest and positive reinforcement is vital for producing long-term fitness improvements. Our mobile fitness game prototype included 13 exercises with functionality to socialize with friends regarding exercise progress and collaboration. A subject pool of 12 adolescents aged 15 to 17 used the prototype for a six week period. Results indicate that the application's socialization features were able to improve subjects' views on fitness activities. Increasing online social networking tendency correlated with improving views on the fitness exercises that were most often engaged in with the application.

The objective of this first phase was to test an initial mobile fitness prototype's efficacy in generating positive attitudinal changes towards fitness activity using strong socialization components within the game. The basic premise being that game play with a strong social aspect is an attractive support mechanism for sustained interest and providing positive reinforcement to users within our fitness application. Such sustained interest and positive reinforcement is vital for producing long-term fitness improvements. Our mobile fitness game prototype included 13 exercises with functionality to socialize with friends regarding exercise progress and collaboration. A subject pool of 12 adolescents aged 15 to 17 used the prototype for a six week period. Results indicate that the application's socialization features were able to improve subjects' views on fitness activities. Increasing online social networking tendency correlated with improving views on the fitness exercises that were most often engaged in with the application."",

80	ESM_2	Mobile Exergames - Burn Calories While Playing Games on a Smartphone	Exergames combine exercising with game play by requiring the users to perform some kind of physical activity (and exercise) in order to score points in the game. In this paper, we present a novel mobile exergaming framework, which requires the users to physically move and jump in order to score points in a game that is played on a smartphone. Our system uses a custom designed Exercising Pad (called ExerPad) in order to track the user's physical movement, and then automatically updates the corresponding game character's position on the screen. The ExerPad contains different shaped images, which are captured from the smartphone's inbuilt camera, and are automatically detected by our shape detection algorithm. We also use the smartphone's inbuilt accelerometer and gyroscope to detect other physical movements from the user such as jumping, turning etc. The experimental results show that the proposed mobile exergames helps its users to burn calories and have fun at the same time.

83	ESM_2	Towards customizable games for stroke rehabilitation	Stroke is the leading cause of long term disability among adults in industrialized nations. The partial paralysis that stroke patients often experience can make independent living difficult or impossible. Research suggests that many of these patients could recover by performing hundreds of daily repetitions of motions with their affected limbs. Yet, only 31\% of patients perform the exercises recommended by their therapists. Home-based stroke rehabilitation games may help motivate stroke patients to perform the necessary exercises to recover. In this paper, we describe a formative study in which we designed and user tested stroke rehabilitation games with both stroke patients and therapists. We describe the lessons we learned about what makes games useful from a therapeutic point of view.	video games;  stroke rehabilitation;  design	Alankus, Gazihan; Lazar, Amanda; May, Matt; Kelleher, Caitlin	CHI '10: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems	https://doi.org/10.1145/1753326.1753649		2113-2122	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/1753326.1753649,

84	ESM_2	Adaptation of Graphics and Gameplay in Fitness Games by Exploiting Motion and Physiological Sensors	Obesity and lack of physical fitness are increasingly common in adults as well as children and can negatively affect health. Regular physical activity, such as jogging or training in a fitness center, is recommended by physiologists to fight obesity and improve one's fitness, but usually requires considerable motivation. Recently, researchers as well as companies have proposed a fewfitness games, i.e. videogames where users play by performing physical exercises, in which game elements (such as graphics and gameplay) are used to encourage people to exercise regularly. This paper proposes a fitness game system which aims at combining arcade-style game graphics, physiological sensors (e.g. heart rate monitor, 3D accelerometer), and an adaptation engine. The adaptation engine considers personal information provided by the user (e.g., age and gender), her current heart rate and movements, and information collected during previous game sessions to adjust the required intensity of physical exercises through context-aware and user-adaptive dynamic adaptations of graphics and gameplay. Besides describing the general system, the paper presents two implemented games and a preliminary user evaluation, which also led us to introduce in the system a 3D virtual human.

The media adaptation problem has significant challenges(a) high dimensionality of adaptation parameter space; (b) variability in the patient performance across and within sessions; (c) the actual rehabilitation plan is typically a non-first-order Markov process, making the learning task hard. Our key insight is to understand media adaptation as a real-time feedback control problem. We use a mixture-of-experts based Dynamic Decision Network (DDN) for online media adaptation. We train DDN mixtures per patient, per session. The mixture models address two basic questions(a) given a specific adaptation suggested by the domain experts, predict the patient performance, and (b) given the expected performance, determine the optimal adaptation decision. The questions are answered through an optimality criterion based search on DDN models trained in previous sessions. We have also developed new validation metrics and have very good results for both questions on actual stroke rehabilitation data. (c) 2008 ACM."",

88	ESM_2	An m-Health system for education and motivation in cardiac rehabilitation: the experience of HeartCycle guided exercise	"Introduction: Home-based programmes for cardiac rehabilitation play a key role in the recovery of patients with coronary artery disease. However, their necessary educational and motivational components have been rarely implemented with the help of modern mobile technologies. We developed a mobile health system designed for motivating patients to adhere to their rehabilitation programme by providing exercise monitoring, guidance, motivational feedback, and educational content. Methods: Our multi-disciplinary approach is based on mapping ""desired behaviours"" into specific system's specifications, borrowing concepts from Fogg's Persuasive Systems Design principles. A randomised controlled trial was conducted to compare mobile-based rehabilitation (55 patients) versus standard care (63 patients). Results: Some technical issues related to connectivity, usability and exercise sessions interrupted by safety algorithms affected the trial. For those who completed the rehabilitation (19 of 55), results show high levels of both user acceptance and perceived usefulness. Adherence in terms of started exercise sessions was high, but not in terms of total time of performed exercise or drop-outs. Educational level about heart-related health improved more in the intervention group than the control. Exercise habits at 6 months follow-up also improved, although without statistical significance. Discussion: Results indicate that the adopted design methodology is promising for creating applications that help improve education and foster better exercise habits, but further studies would be needed to confirm these indications."

89	ESM_2	Randomized trial of an internet-based computer-tailored expert system for physical activity in patients with heart disease	Background: The CardioFit internet-based expert system was designed to promote physical activity in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) who were not participating in cardiac rehabilitation. Design: This randomized controlled trial compared CardioFit to usual care to assess its effects on physical activity following hospitalization for acute coronary syndromes. Methods: A total of 223 participants were recruited at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute or London Health Sciences Centre and randomly assigned to either CardioFit (n = 115) or usual care (n = 108). The CardioFit group received a personally tailored physical-activity plan upon discharge from the hospital and access to a secure website for activity planning and tracking. They completed five online tutorials over a 6-month period and were in email contact with an exercise specialist. Usual care consisted of physical activity guidance from an attending cardiologist. Physical activity was measured by pedometer and self-reported over a 7-day period, 6 and 12 months after randomization.Results: The CardioFit internet-based physical activity expert system significantly increased objectively measured (p = 0.023) and self-reported physical activity (p = 0.047) compared to usual care. Emotional (p = 0.038) and physical (p = 0.031) dimensions of heart disease health-related quality of life were also higher with CardioFit compared to usual care.Conclusions: Patients with CHD using an internet-based activity prescription with online coaching were more physically active at follow up than those receiving usual care. Use of the CardioFit program could extend the reach of rehabilitation and secondary-prevention services.

90	ESM_2	The development and codesign of the PATHway intervention: A theory-driven eHealth platform for the self-management of cardiovascular disease	Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of premature death worldwide. International guidelines recommend routine delivery of all phases of cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Uptake of traditional CR remains suboptimal, as attendance at formal hospital-based CR programs is low, with community-based CR rates and individual long-term exercise maintenance even lower. Home-based CR programs have been shown to be equally effective in clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes and yet are not readily available. The aim of the current study was to develop the PATHway intervention (physical activity toward health) for the self-management of CVD. Increasing physical activity in individuals with CVD was the primary behavior. The PATHway intervention was theoretically informed by the behavior change wheel and social cognitive theory. All relevant intervention functions, behavior change techniques, and policy categories were identified and translated into intervention content. Furthermore, a person-centered approach was adopted involving an iterative codesign process and extensive user testing. Education, enablement, modeling, persuasion, training, and social restructuring were selected as appropriate intervention functions. Twenty-two behavior change techniques, linked to the six intervention functions and three policy categories, were identified for inclusion and translated into PATHway intervention content. This paper details the use of the behavior change wheel and social cognitive theory to develop an eHealth intervention for the self-management of CVD. The systematic and transparent development of the PATHway intervention will facilitate the evaluation of intervention effectiveness and future replication.

The AwToolkit widgets automatically determine which display a user is looking at and provide users with notifications with different levels of subtlety to make the user aware of any unattended display changes. The toolkit uses four notification levels (unnoticeable, subtle, intrusive and disruptive), ranging from an almost imperceptible visual change to a clear and visually saliant change. We describe AwToolkit's six widgets, which have been designed for C# developers, and the design of a user study with an application oriented towards healthcare environments.

92	ESM_2	Communication and interaction strategies in automotive adaptive interfaces	Today's drivers have to cope with a growing amount of information coming from on-board information messages, telematics and advanced driver assistance systems. The interaction between the driver and these systems is critical since it may distract the driver from the primary task of driving. The paper, addressing this problem has a twofold aim: in one hand to carry out a review of past and current initiatives on the optimization of human machine interfaces (HMI) in the automotive research area. On the other hand it presents relevant results, investigates research and market trends and proposes strategies and architectures for future implementation.

The interaction between the driver and these systems is critical since it may distract the driver from the primary task of driving. The paper, addressing this problem has a twofold aim: in one hand to carry out a review of past and current initiatives on the optimization of human machine interfaces (HMI) in the automotive research area. On the other hand it presents relevant results, investigates research and market trends and proposes strategies and architectures for future implementation. The COMUNICAR project presented is the most well-know European project - as an example for past activities, while the AIDE integrated project and its vision is proposed as the roadmap for future activities"",

The framework uses an innovative form of online GOMS analysis to provide the user with tailored customization suggestions aimed at maximizing the user's performance with the interface. The suggestions are presented non-intrusively, minimizing disruption and allowing the user to maintain full control. The framework has been applied to a general user-productivity application.

94	ESM_2	Design and evaluation of an adaptive icon toolbar	As information systems become increasingly important in many different domains, the potential to adapt them to individual users and their needs also becomes more important. Adaptive user interfaces offer many possible ways to adjust displays and improve procedures for a user's individual patterns of work. This paper describes an attempt to design an adaptive user interface in a computer environment familiar to many users. According to one classification of adaptive user interfaces, the adaptive bar described in this paper would be classified as a user-controlled self-adaptation system. At the user's convenience, the adaptive bar offers suggestions for adding or removing command icons, based on the frequency and probability of specific commands. It also implements these changes once the user has agreed to them. Beyond the adaptive bar, the general behavior of the whole user interface does not change, thereby allowing the user to maintain a clear general model of the system. This paper describes the decision-making algorithm implemented in the bar. It also describes the bar's self-adaptive behavior of displaying the frequency of each icon's use through the icon's size. Finally, we present some encouraging preliminary results of evaluations by users.

95	ESM_2	Complementary menus: Combining adaptable and adaptive approaches for menu interface	This study proposes a method of coupling adaptable and adaptive approaches to the design of menus. The proposed complementary menu types incorporate both adaptability and adaptivity by dividing and allocating menu adaptation roles to the user and the system. Four different types of interface adaptation (i.e., adaptable with/without system support and adaptive with/without user control) were defined. They were implemented in a hypothetical prototype mobile phone via a hotlist (an additional collection of quickly accessible items). A controlled lab experiment was conducted to compare the menu types and investigate the effects of the system support in the adaptable menus and the user control in the adaptive menus. Twenty subjects participated in the experiment and performed menu selection tasks. Both performance and user satisfaction measures were collected. The results showed that adaptable and adaptive menus were superior to the traditional one in terms of both performance and user satisfaction. Providing system support to the adaptable menu not only increased the users' perception of the efficiency of selection, but also reduced the menu adaptation time. Important implications for the design of menus are described and valuable insights into the menu interface adaptation were gained from the quantitative and qualitative analyses of the experimental results. Relevance to industry: The evaluation experiment conducted in this study may provide valuable information to designers of adaptive or adaptable menus. Adding system support to adaptable menu would be an attractive option to consider. Also, the results of a user survey provide useful information to the practitioners in mobile phone industry on the features users accessed most frequently.

96	ESM_2	Optimising engagement for stroke rehabilitation using serious games	Effective stroke rehabilitation must be early, intensive and repetitive, which can lead to problems with patient motivation and engagement. The design of video games, often associated with good user engagement, may offer insights into how more effective systems for stroke rehabilitation can be developed. In this paper we identify game design principles for upper limb stroke rehabilitation and present several games developed using these principles. The games use low-cost video-capture technology which may make them suitable for deployment at home. Results from evaluating the games with both healthy subjects and people with stroke in their home are encouraging.

98	ESM_2	Self-adaptive games for rehabilitation at home	Computer games are a promising tool to support rehabilitation at home. It is widely recognized that rehabilitation games should (i) be nicely integrated in general-purpose rehabilitation stations, (ii) adhere to the constraints posed by the clinical protocols, (iii) involve movements that are functional to reach the rehabilitation goal, and (iv) adapt to the patients' current status and progress. However, the vast majority of existing rehabilitation games are stand-alone applications (not integrated in a patient station), that rarely adapt to the patients' condition. In this paper, we present the first prototype of the patient rehabilitation station we developed that integrates video games for rehabilitation with methods of computational intelligence both for on-line monitoring the movements' execution during the games and for adapting the gameplay to the patients' status. The station employs a fuzzy system to monitor the exercises execution, on-line, according to the clinical constraints defined by the therapist at configuration time, and to provide direct feedback to the patients. At the same time, it applies real-time adaptation (using the Quest Bayesian adaptive approach) to modify the gameplay according both (i) to the patient current performance and progress and (ii) to the exercise plan specified by the therapist. Finally, we present one of the games available in our patient stations (designed in tight cooperation with therapists) that integrates monitoring functionalities with in-game self-adaptation to provide the best support possible to patients during their routine.

Our tensor factorization approach is data-driven and can predict changes in players' skill mastery over time, allowing more accurate tailoring of challenges.

The presence of difficulty adjustment in the game allows a higher motivation level for the patients by preserving the trade off between keeping the difficulty low enough to avoid frustration, but high enough to promote motivation and engagement. This rehabilitation game is a home-based system that allows the patient to exercise at home, due to its Kinect-based portable setup.

101	ESM_2	RehaBot: Gamified Virtual Assistants Towards Adaptive TeleRehabilitation	This paper introduces 'RehaBot', a framework for building adaptive serious games in the context of telerehabilitation. RehaBot takes advantage of 3D motion tracking and virtual reality devices, to develop an immersive and gamified telerehabilitation environment. A personalized and adaptive gaming system is developed, which allows patients to perform exercises with the help of embedded virtual assistants, hereafter called 'rehab bots', that are dynamically displayed within scenes to guide the patient through the different sets of gestures required to complete the session. These rehab bots have the ability to learn and adapt to the best level of difficulty in real-time based on the user performance. An intelligent alerting and automatic correction technique is incorporated within our engine, so that pre-calculated gesture patterns are correlated and matched with patients' gestures. Consequently, the system estimates the perceived difficulty of gestures by the patient, and automatically adjusts the game behavior to ensure a highly engaging and adaptive gaming experience. Furthermore, multimodal instructions are conveyed to users with details on joints that are not performing as expected, and to guide them towards improving the current gesture. A pilot study has been conducted to prove the usability and effectiveness of our adaptive physiotherapy solution.	user adaptation;  telerehabilitation;  serious games;  intelligent alerting;  automatic correction	Afyouni, Imad; Einea, Anas; Murad, Abdullah	UMAP'19 Adjunct: Adjunct Publication of the 27th Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization	https://doi.org/10.1145/3314183.3324988		21-26	"""@inproceedings{10.1145/3314183.3324988,

103	ESM_2	Nocturnal sensing and intervention for assisted living of people with dementia	This chapter explains the technological infrastructure of Nocturnal within the context of sensing and actuation used in ambient assistive living (AAL), highlights the peculiarities of assisting people in the hours of darkness, and focuses on the consequences to society of the AAL-associated technology. People with dementia may have a much more pronounced and immediate need for help and support as they awake in an unknown, dark environment. Nocturnal can be set up to monitor every room within the home of the person with dementia. Important requirements for nocturnal care of people with dementia are more specialized algorithms to infer behaviour from sparse data; specially designed interventions, perhaps including music and video, that provide therapeutic support to people to reduce anxiety; and sophisticated guidance, perhaps through the use of lightning. There is a significant body of research that has described the needs of people with dementia and has produced solutions to address those needs using information and communication technologies.

104	ESM_2	Visualization of data for ambient assisted living services	Ambient assisted living (AAL) services that provide support for people to remain in their homes are increasingly being used in healthcare systems around the world. Typically, these ambient assisted living services provide additional information though location-awareness, presence-awareness, and context-awareness capabilities, arising from the prolific use of telecommunications devices including sensors and actuators in the home of the person receiving care. In addition there is a need to provide abstract information, in context, to local and remote stakeholders. There are many different viewing options utilizing converged networks and the resulting explosion in data and information has resulted in a new problem, as these new ambient assisted living services struggle to convey meaningful information to different groups of end users. The article discusses visualization of data from the perspective of the needs of the differing end user groups, and discusses how algorithms are required to contextualize and convey information across location and time. In order to illustrate the issues, current work on nighttime AAL services for people with dementia is described.

105	ESM_2	Mobile app development and usability research to help dementia and Alzheimer patients	Caregiver anecdotes attest that music and photographs play an important role for family members diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), even those with severe AD. Tablets and iPads, which are prevalent, can be utilized with dementia patients in portraying favorite music and family photographs via apps developed in close partnership with geriatric facilities. Anecdotal research has shown that non-verbal late-stage dementia patients have become stimulated when iPods played their beloved tunes. There is an unmet need in geriatric facilities for stimulating dementia patients, as well providing hard-core data for proving increased cognitive abilities with technology. Technology can help bridge the gap between patients and staff to improve the quality of life for the cognitively impaired. This study addresses cognitive functioning and quality of life for people diagnosed with dementia via technology. In recent times, the influx of older adults suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia related illness has impacted the U.S. Healthcare system. Cognition significantly declines in older adults with AD or dementia over the course of the disease, causing most to be dependent on caregivers, thus routinely institutionalized. Caregivers are often required to focus their attention on addressing the agitation or discomfort of the AD or dementia patient. Research has shown that technology instruments such as iPods, help stimulate those with dementia. This study focuses on innovative devices such as iPads and tablets, which are mainstream and easy to use, cannot only help determine stage of dementia, but also provide stimulation to improve cognitive functioning. It is hoped that this research will analyze that specially created apps and existing assistive software can be used to decrease the symptoms and improve cognition of older adults suffering from AD or other dementia related diseases. Via service-learning courses, students developed an easy-to-use application for tablets to help older adults with disabilities more readily use the technology. Student programmers produced apps and performed usability tests with the dementia patients, as well as met with geriatric facility personnel to produce application software that meets the patients, family, and caregiver needs and expectations. For example, a student term project produced an application entitled Candoo that utilizes Google's voice recognition and synthesis engine to navigate the web, provide the weather, and supply pill reminder alerts. Another application example included one that allows families to electronically send photographs, video clips, and favorite music from anywhere to loved ones for enjoyment. Furthermore, older adults were assessed by nursing students for cognitive functioning before, and after the semester's intervention. Such mobile apps could allow dementia persons to become less agitated and stay in their homes longer, while also providing awareness and positive change of attitude by those of another generation towards the elderly. This research will discuss student developed mobile applications in the scope of helping improve the quality of life of patients with AD or dementia.

In this significant circumstance, the appearance of smart technologies has kept promising success regarding Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Many socio-developmental mobile applications have been created in developed countries. In contrast, there are no such applications in developing countries like Bangladesh in native content. In this paper, an Android-based mobile application named HELLO is designed with the fundamental thought of Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) in the Bangla language. This application aims to improve the socio-communicational learnability of autism individuals in Bangladesh. It is expected that our application can be brilliant support to autism individuals, also included the people who endure non-verbal inconveniences. The outcome of this application demonstrates a positive streamline to the improvement in communicating with others.

108	ESM_2	Development of a Mobile Application Using Augmentative and Alternative Communication and Video Modelling for Autistic Children	"Purpose: The aim of this project is to report on a mobile application which has integrated
Augmented and Alternative Communication and video modeling approaches. A usability
testing has been conducted on the developed application.
Design/methodology/approach: The authors have developed a mobile application, AutiAct.
In order to do so, an interview has been conducted with teachers. Observations have been made
with 4 ASD children aged 7 to 12 years, each of whom has different types of severity, while
usability tests and interview questions have been conducted with 3 teachers from the National
Autism Society of Malaysia (NASOM) to test the effectiveness of AutiAct.
Findings: A mobile application, AutiAct, has been developed through the introduction of video
modeling and Augmentative Alternative Communication approaches to assist autistic children
in their everyday routine. The procedure in the application is simple and can be followed step
by step for autistic children. Based on the testing, all the respondents have 100% agreed that
AutiAct is an appropriate tool to assist and enhance autism children with their daily life skills.
Results also have shown that video modelling and AAC are an important tool to be used to
improve the abilities of autistic children.
Practical implications: Results have shown that AutiAct is reliable to help autistic children
improve their independent skills so that they will depend less on their parents as they grow
older and that it also embeds a character building for autistic children to help them shape their
personality and characteristics."	Mobile application; Augmented and Alternative Communication; Video Modeling; Autistic Children	W. F. W. Ahmad and N. A. B.

109	ESM_2	Usability of an adaptive computer assistant that improves self-care and health literacy of older adults	Objectives: We developed an adaptive computer assistant for the supervision of diabetics' self-care, to support limiting illness and need for acute treatment, and improve health literacy. This assistant monitors self-care activities logged in the patient's electronic diary. Accordingly, it provides context-aware feedback. The objective was to evaluate whether older adults in general can make use of the computer assistant and to compare an adaptive computer assistant with a fixed one, concerning its usability and contribution to health literacy. Methods: We conducted a laboratory experiment in the Georgia Tech Aware Home wherein 28 older adults participated in a usability evaluation of the computer assistant, while engaged in scenarios reflecting normal and health-critical situations. We evaluated the assistant on effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, and educational value. Finally, we studied the moderating effects of the subjects' personal characteristics. Results: Logging self-care tasks and receiving feedback from the computer assistant enhanced the subjects' knowledge of diabetes. The adaptive assistant was more effective in dealing with normal and health-critical situations, and, generally, it led to more time efficiency. Subjects' personal characteristics had substantial effects on the effectiveness and efficiency of the two computer assistants. Conclusions: Older adults were able to use the adoptive computer assistant. In addition, it had a positive effect on the development of health literacy. The assistant has the potential to support older diabetics' self care while maintaining quality of life.

110	ESM_2	Educating parents in dealing with childhood obesity through the use of the BMI monitor APP	Childhood obesity has now reached an alarming level among children. It affects one out of every ten children all over the world. While in Malaysia, overweight child is 38 percent of the child population. If it is not effectively curbed, childhood obesity will cause many problems. Previous studies have shown that parents are responsible for their children's well-being and their involvement is the most influential treatment to childhood obesity. With the advent of mobile technology, various mobile apps have been developed to manage people's daily lives. This paper elaborates on the development of the BMI monitor app, a mobile application which is intended to be used by parents to monitor their children's Body Mass Index (BMI). It uses the BMI Percentile method which is recommended by pediatricians worldwide. This app enables parents to store all the BMI records of the children and also provides advices to help parents to deal with the childhood obesity problems. This paper also discusses on the outcome of an evaluation that has been conducted among a sample of parents towards the use of the app. It is hoped that the use of the app will ease the parents in monitoring their children's BMI status and eventually formed them to be more responsible parents.

111	ESM_2	Framework for personalized and adaptive game-based training programs in health sport	This paper describes an interdisciplinary approach towards a framework for personalized, game-based training programs for elderly and handicapped people. Adaptation and personalization are proposed as a way to increase the physiological training effects of game-based training programs (exergames). Hereby, the diversity of users and a broad range of physiological handicaps are considered. The framework is based on scientific training programs enhanced by technical methods and concepts for personalized exergames. This includes an authoring environment (StoryTec) which supports game designers and domain experts (sport scientists, medical doctors, therapists, etc.) in the development process and the (personalized) configuration of such exergames. Two prototypically implemented applications (ErgoActive and BalanceFit) demonstrate the usability and adaptation of the underlying training and game concepts for different user groups and provide indicators of the effectiveness and efficiency of the generic framework for particular user groups. For instance, ErgoActive is applicable for people of all ages and both trained and untrained users by being able to provide personalized training levels to improve endurance. Similarly, BalanceFit is useful both for wheelchair and walking frame users in order to maintain and possibly even increase their balance, strength and muscular coordination.

112	ESM_2	Flowers or a robot army?:encouraging awareness & activity with personal, mobile displays	Personal, mobile displays, such as those on mobile phones, are ubiquitous, yet for the most part, underutilized. We present results from a field experiment that investigated the effectiveness of these displays as a means for improving awareness of daily life (in our case, self-monitoring of physical activity). Twenty-eight participants in three experimental conditions used our UbiFit system for a period of three months in their day-to-day lives over the winter holiday season. Our results show, for example, that participants who had an awareness display were able to maintain their physical activity level (even during the holidays), while the level of physical activity for participants who did not have an awareness display dropped significantly. We discuss our results and their general implications for the use of everyday mobile devices as awareness displays.	ambient display; awareness; calm technology; field experiment; fitness; glanceable display; mobile phone; personal mobile display; persuasive technology; physical activity	Sunny Consolvo; Predrag Klasnja; David W.

113	ESM_2	Fish'n'Steps: Encouraging Physical Activity with an Interactive Computer Game	A sedentary lifestyle is a contributing factor to chronic diseases, and it is often correlated with obesity. To promote an increase in physical activity, we created a social computer game, Fish'n'Steps, which links a player's daily foot step count to the growth and activity of an animated virtual character, a fish in a fish tank. As further encouragement, some of the players' fish tanks included other players' fish, thereby creating an environment of both cooperation and competition. In a fourteen-week study with nineteen participants, the game served as a catalyst for promoting exercise and for improving game players' attitudes towards physical activity. Furthermore, although most player's enthusiasm in the game decreased after the game's first two weeks, analyzing the results using Prochaska's Transtheoretical Model of Behavioral Change suggests that individuals had, by that time, established new routines that led to healthier patterns of physical activity in their daily lives. Lessons learned from this study underscore the value of such games to encourage rather than provide negative reinforcement, especially when individuals are not meeting their own expectations, to foster long-term behavioral change.
