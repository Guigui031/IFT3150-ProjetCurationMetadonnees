0	TrustSE	On the impact of security vulnerabilities in the npm package dependency network	Security vulnerabilities are among the most pressing problems in open source software package libraries. It may take a long time to discover and fix vulnerabilities in packages. In addition, vulnerabilities may propagate to dependent packages, making them vulnerable too. This paper presents an empirical study of nearly 400 security reports over a 6-year period in the npm dependency network containing over 610k JavaScript packages. Taking into account the severity of vulnerabilities, we analyse how and when these vulnerabilities are discovered and fixed, and to which extent they affect other packages in the packaging ecosystem in presence of dependency constraints. We report our findings and provide guidelines for package maintainers and tool developers to improve the process of dealing with security issues.	dependency network;  security vulnerability;  semantic versioning;  software ecosystem;  software repository mining	Decan, Alexandre; Mens, Tom; Constantinou, Eleni	MSR '18: Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories	https://doi.org/10.1145/3196398.3196401		181-191	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3196398.3196401,

6	TrustSE	Assessing Software Service Quality and Trustworthiness at Selection Time	The integration of external software in project development is challenging and risky, notably because the execution quality of the software and the trustworthiness of the software provider may be unknown at integration time. This is a timely problem and of increasing importance with the advent of the SaaS model of service delivery. Therefore, in choosing the SaaS service to utilize, project managers must identify and evaluate the level of risk associated with each candidate. Trust is commonly assessed through reputation systems; however, existing systems rely on ratings provided by consumers. This raises numerous issues involving the subjectivity and unfairness of the service ratings. This paper describes a framework for reputation-aware software service selection and rating. A selection algorithm is devised for service recommendation, providing SaaS consumers with the best possible choices based on quality, cost, and trust. An automated rating model, based on the expectancy-disconfirmation theory from market science, is also defined to overcome feedback subjectivity issues. The proposed rating and selection models are validated through simulations, demonstrating that the system can effectively capture service behavior and recommend the best possible choices.

10	TrustSE	Software ecosystem call graph for dependency management	A popular form of software reuse is the use of open source software libraries hosted on centralized code repositories, such as Maven or npm. Developers only need to declare dependencies to external libraries, and automated tools make them available to the workspace of the project. Recent incidents, such as the Equifax data breach and the leftpad package removal, demonstrate the difficulty in assessing the severity, impact and spread of bugs in dependency networks. While dependency checkers are being adapted as a counter measure, they only provide indicative information. To remedy this situation, we propose a fine-grained dependency network that goes beyond packages and into call graphs. The result is a versioned ecosystem-level call graph. In this paper, we outline the process to construct the proposed graph and present a preliminary evaluation of a security issue from a core package to an affected client application.

12	TrustSE	Trusting a library: A study of the latency to adopt the latest Maven release	With the popularity of open source library (re)use in both industrial and open source settings, `trust' plays vital role in third-party library adoption. Trust involves the assumption of both functional and non-functional correctness. Even with the aid of dependency management build tools such as Maven and Gradle, research have still found a latency to trust the latest release of a library. In this paper, we investigate the trust of OSS libraries. Our study of 6,374 systems in Maven Super Repository suggests that 82% of systems are more trusting of adopting the latest library release to existing systems. We uncover the impact of maven on latent and trusted library adoptions.

15	TrustSE	On the topology of package dependency networks: a comparison of three programming language ecosystems	Package-based software ecosystems are composed of thousands of interdependent software packages. Many empirical studies have focused on software packages belonging to a single software ecosystem, and suggest to generalise the results to more ecosystems. We claim that such a generalisation is not always possible, because the technical structure of software ecosystems can be very different, even if these ecosystems belong to the same domain. We confirm this claim through a study of three big and popular package-based programming language ecosystems: R's CRAN archive network, Python's PyPI distribution, and JavaScript's NPM package manager. We study and compare the structure of their package dependency graphs and reveal some important differences that may make it difficult to generalise the findings of one ecosystem to another one.

We study and compare the structure of their package dependency graphs and reveal some important differences that may make it difficult to generalise the findings of one ecosystem to another one."",

16	TrustSE	When GitHub Meets CRAN: An Analysis of Inter-Repository Package Dependency Problems	When developing software packages in a software ecosystem, an important and well-known challenge is how to deal with dependencies to other packages. In presence of multiple package repositories, dependency management tends to become even more problematic. For the R ecosystem of statistical computing, dependency management is currently insufficient to deal with multiple package versions and inter-repository package dependencies. We explore how the use of GitHub influences the R ecosystem, both for the distribution of R packages and for inter-repository package dependency management. We also discuss how these problems could be addressed.

18	TrustSE	Security and trust requirements engineering	Integrating security concerns throughout the whole software development process is one of today's challenges in software and requirements engineering research. A challenge that so far has proved difficult to meet.The major difficulty is that providing security does not only require to solve technical problems but also to reason on the organization as a whole. This makes the usage of traditional software engineering methologies difficult or unsatisfactory: most proposals focus on protection aspects of security and explicitly deal with low level protection mechanisms and only an handful of them show the ability of capturing the high-level organizational security requirements, without getting suddenly bogged down into security protocols or cryptography algorithms.In this paper we critically review the state of the art in security requirements engineering and discuss the motivations that led us to propose the Secure Tropos methodology, a formal framework for modelling and analyzing security, that enhances the agent-oriented software development methodology i*/Tropos. We illustrate the Secure Tropos approach, a comprehensive case study, and discuss some later refinements of the Secure Tropos methodology to address some of its shortcomings. Finally, we introduce the ST-Tool, a CASE tool that supports our methodology.

22	TrustSE	Competition and collaboration in requirements engineering: A case study of an emerging software ecosystem	Increasingly, small to medium software producing organisations are working together in collaboration networks to supply complex compositions of their products and services to customers. In this paper, we present a case study of two software companies that are evolving their partnership towards the creation of a software ecosystem. We investigate the impacts of their tightening partnership on software product management, with a focus on requirements engineering practices. We observe that the requirements definition and negotiation processes are directly affected by their fluid collaborative and competitive relationships. Power disputes, volatile roles and mismatches in release synchronisation are also aspects observed in the studied software ecosystem.We extract several observations from the case study that support small to medium software firms in making decisions within their software ecosystem.

27	TrustSE	From ratings to trust: an empirical study of implicit trust in recommender systems	Trust has been extensively studied and its effectiveness demonstrated in recommender systems. Due to the lack of explicit trust information in most systems, many trust metric approaches have been proposed to infer implicit trust from user ratings. However, previous works have not compared these different approaches, and oftentimes focus only on the performance of predictive item ratings. In this paper, we first analyse five kinds of trust metrics in light of the properties of trust. We conduct an empirical study to explore the ability of trust metrics to distinguish explicit trust from implicit trust and to generate accurate predictions. Experimental results on two real-world data sets show that existing trust metrics cannot provide satisfying performance, and indicate that future metrics should be designed more carefully.	trust metrics;  similarity;  recommender systems;  ratings	Guo, Guibing; Zhang, Jie; Thalmann, Daniel; Basu, Anirban; Yorke-Smith, Neil	SAC '14: Proceedings of the 29th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing	https://doi.org/10.1145/2554850.2554878		248-253	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2554850.2554878,

28	TrustSE	A Survey on Trust Modeling	The concept of trust and/or trust management has received considerable attention in engineering research communities as trust is perceived as the basis for decision making in many contexts and the motivation for maintaining long-term relationships based on cooperation and collaboration. Even if substantial research effort has been dedicated to addressing trust-based mechanisms or trust metrics (or computation) in diverse contexts, prior work has not clearly solved the issue of how to model and quantify trust with sufficient detail and context-based adequateness. The issue of trust quantification has become more complicated as we have the need to derive trust from complex, composite networks that may involve four distinct layers of communication protocols, information exchange, social interactions, and cognitive motivations. In addition, the diverse application domains require different aspects of trust for decision making such as emotional, logical, and relational trust. This survey aims to outline the foundations of trust models for applications in these contexts in terms of the concept of trust, trust assessment, trust constructs, trust scales, trust properties, trust formulation, and applications of trust. We discuss how different components of trust can be mapped to different layers of a complex, composite network; applicability of trust metrics and models; research challenges; and future work directions.	trustor;  trustee;  trust;  decision making;  composite trust;  Trust modeling	Cho, Jin-Hee; Chan, Kevin; Adali, Sibel	ACM Comput.

    abstract = ""The concept of trust and/or trust management has received considerable attention in engineering research communities as trust is perceived as the basis for decision making in many contexts and the motivation for maintaining long-term relationships based on cooperation and collaboration. Even if substantial research effort has been dedicated to addressing trust-based mechanisms or trust metrics (or computation) in diverse contexts, prior work has not clearly solved the issue of how to model and quantify trust with sufficient detail and context-based adequateness. The issue of trust quantification has become more complicated as we have the need to derive trust from complex, composite networks that may involve four distinct layers of communication protocols, information exchange, social interactions, and cognitive motivations. In addition, the diverse application domains require different aspects of trust for decision making such as emotional, logical, and relational trust. This survey aims to outline the foundations of trust models for applications in these contexts in terms of the concept of trust, trust assessment, trust constructs, trust scales, trust properties, trust formulation, and applications of trust. We discuss how different components of trust can be mapped to different layers of a complex, composite network; applicability of trust metrics and models; research challenges; and future work directions."",

29	TrustSE	Enabling trusted software integrity	Preventing execution of unauthorized software on a given computer plays a pivotal role in system security. The key problem is that although a program at the beginning of its execution can be verified as authentic, while running, its execution flow can be redirected to externally injected malicious code using, for example, a buffer overflow exploit. Existing techniques address this problem by trying to detect the intrusion at run-time or by formally verifying that the software is not prone to a particular attack.We take a radically different approach to this problem. We aim at intrusion prevention as the core technology for enabling secure computing systems. Intrusion prevention systems force an adversary to solve a computationally hard task in order to create a binary that can be executed on a given machine. In this paper, we present an exemplary system--SPEF--a combination of architectural and compilation techniques that ensure software integrity at run-time. SPEF embeds encrypted, processor-specific constraints into each block of instructions at software installation time and then verifies their existence at run-time. Thus, the processor can execute only properly installed programs, which makes installation the only system gate that needs to be protected. We have designed a SPEF prototype based on the ARM instruction set and validated its impact on security and performance using the MediaBench suite of applications.

30	TrustSE	A software-based Trusted Platform Module emulator	When developing and researching new trusted computing technologies, appropriate tools to investigate their behavior and to evaluate their performance are of paramount importance. In this paper, we present, an efficient and portable TPM emulator for Unix. Our emulator enables not only the implementation of flexible and low-cost test-beds and simulators but, in addition, provides programmers of trusted systems with a powerful testing and debugging tool that can also be used for educational purposes. Thanks to its portability and interoperability, the TPM emulator runs on a variety of platforms and is compatible with the most relevant software packages and interfaces.

44	TrustSE	Structure and evolution of package dependency networks	Software developers often include available open-source software packages into their projects to minimize redundant effort. However, adding a package to a project can also introduce risks, which can propagate through multiple levels of dependencies. Currently, not much is known about the structure of open-source package ecosystems of popular programming languages and the extent to which transitive bug propagation is possible. This paper analyzes the dependency network structure and evolution of the JavaScript, Ruby, and Rust ecosystems. The reported results reveal significant differences across language ecosystems. The results indicate that the number of transitive dependencies for JavaScript has grown 60\% over the last year, suggesting that developers should look more carefully into their dependencies to understand what exactly is included. The study also reveals that vulnerability to a removal of the most popular package is increasing, yet most other packages have a decreasing impact on vulnerability. The findings of this study can inform the development of dependency management tools.

These package managers use different security mechanisms that provide varying levels of usability and resilience to attack. We find that, despite their existing security mechanisms, all of these package managers have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a man-in-the-middle or a malicious mirror. While all current package managers suffer from vulnerabilities, their security is also positively or negatively impacted by the distribution's security practices. Weaknesses in package managers are more easily exploited when distributions use third-party mirrors as official mirrors. We were successful in using false credentials to obtain an official mirror on all five of the distributions we attempted. We also found that some security mechanisms that control where a client obtains metadata and packages from may actually decrease security. We analyze current package managers to show that by exploiting vulnerabilities, an attacker with a mirror can compromise or crash hundreds to thousands of clients weekly. The problems we disclose are now being corrected by many different package manager maintainers.	mirrors;  package management;  replay attack	Cappos, Justin; Samuel, Justin; Baker, Scott; Hartman, John H.

57	TrustSE	Entering the circle of trust: developer initiation as committers in open-source projects	The success of an open-source project depends to a large degree on the proactive and constructive participation by the developer community. An important role that developers play in a project is that of a code committer. However, code-commit privilege is typically restricted to the core group of a project. In this paper, we study the phenomenon of the induction of external developers as code committers. The trustworthiness of an external developer is one of the key factors that determines the granting of commit privileges. Therefore, we formulate different hypotheses to explain how the trust is established in practice. To investigate our hypotheses, we developed an automated approach based on mining code repositories and bug-tracking systems. We implemented the approach and performed an empirical study, using the Eclipse projects, to test the hypotheses. Our results indicate that, most frequently, developers establish trust and credibility in a project by contributing to the project in a non-committer role. Moreover, the employing organization of a developer is another factor--although a less significant one--that influences trust.	code committer;  developer roles;  mining bug repository;  mining code repository;  open-source software	Sinha, Vibha Singhal; Mani, Senthil; Sinha, Saurabh	MSR '11: Proceedings of the 8th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories	https://doi.org/10.1145/1985441.1985462		133-142	"@inproceedings{10.1145/1985441.1985462,

Moreover, the employing organization of a developer is another factor--although a less significant one--that influences trust."",

67	TrustSE	Multi-dimensions of Developer Trustworthiness Assessment in OSS Community	With the prosperity of the Open Source Software, various software communities are formed and they attract huge amounts of developers to participate in distributed software development. For such software development paradigm, how to evaluate the skills of the developers comprehensively and automatically is critical. However, most of the existing researches assess the developers based on the Implementation aspects, such as the artifacts they created or edited. They ignore the developers' contributions in Social collaboration aspects, such as answering questions, giving advices, making comments or creating social connections. In this paper, we propose a novel model which evaluate the individuals' skills from both Implementation and Social collaboration aspects. Our model defines four metrics from muti-dimensions, including collaboration index, technical skill, community influence and development contribution. We carry out experiments on a real-world online software community. The results show that our approach can make more comprehensive measurement than the previous work.

68	TrustSE	Theory of software reliability based on components	We present a foundational theory of software system reliability based on components. The theory describes how component developers can design and test their components to produce measurements that are later used by system designers to calculate composite system reliability -- without implementation and test of the system being designed. The theory describes how to make component measurements that are independent of operational profiles, and how to incorporate the overall system-level operational profile into the system reliability calculations. In principle, the theory resolves the central problem of assessing a component, which is: a component developer cannot know how the component will be used and so cannot certify it for an arbitrary use; but if the component buyer must certify each component before using it, component-based development loses much of its appeal. This dilemma is resolved if the component developer does the certification and provides the results in such a way that the component buyer can factor in the usage information later, without repeating the certification. Our theory addresses the basic technical problems inherent in certifying components to be released for later use in an arbitrary system.Most component research has been directed at functional specification of software components; our theory addresses the other, equally important, side of the coin: component quality.

When considering an open source component, prospective users should evaluate the project for several characteristics: maturity, longevity, and flexibility. For greatest benefit, the users should also build and maintain a strong working relationship with the component's developers. We compiled our experiences developing SAP into a developer's guide for those considering using open source in their mission-critical application. In addition to discussing how to evaluate open source components suitability for inclusion in a mission-critical application, the guide suggests strategies for working with open source development teams.

There is a potential for this transparency to radically improve collaboration and learning in complex knowledge-based activities. Based on a series of in-depth interviews with central and peripheral GitHub users, we examined the value of transparency for large-scale distributed collaborations and communities of practice. We find that people make a surprisingly rich set of social inferences from the networked activity information in GitHub, such as inferring someone else's technical goals and vision when they edit code, or guessing which of several similar projects has the best chance of thriving in the long term.

We analyzed these logs for the information that developers sought, the sources that they used, and the situations that prevented information from being acquired. We identified twenty-one information types and cataloged the outcome and source when each type of information was sought. The most frequently sought information included awareness about artifacts and coworkers. The most often deferred searches included knowledge about design and program behavior, such as why code was written a particular way, what a program was supposed to do, and the cause of a program state.

84	TrustSE	The secret life of bugs: Going past the errors and omissions in software repositories	Every bug has a story behind it. The people that discover and resolve it need to coordinate, to get information from documents, tools, or other people, and to navigate through issues of accountability, ownership, and organizational structure. This paper reports on a field study of coordination activities around bug fixing that used a combination of case study research and a survey of software professionals.

85	TrustSE	Scalable architectural support for trusted software	We present Bastion, a new hardware-software architecture for protecting security-critical software modules in an untrusted software stack. Our architecture is composed of enhanced microprocessor hardware and enhanced hypervisor software. Each trusted software module is provided with a secure, fine-grained memory compartment and its own secure persistent storage area. Bastion is the first architecture to provide direct hardware protection of the hypervisor from both software and physical attacks, before employing the hypervisor to provide the same protection to security-critical OS and application modules. Our implementation demonstrates the feasibility of bypassing an untrusted commodity OS to provide application security and shows better security with higher performance when compared to the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), the current industry state-of-the-art security chip. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation on the OpenSPARC platform.

93	TrustSE	Software preannouncements and their impact on customers' perceptions and vendor reputation	"Software preannouncements are often called ""vaporware"" (systems or features announced long before a ship date). The challenge confronting software vendors and consumers is understanding the balance between the need to inform the market and the negative consequences of unfulfilled promises. Based on signaling theory from marketing science and research, this study looks at the perceived importance of software preannouncement factors on customers, of unfulfilled promises and unreliable software on a company's reputation, and whether vendor dependence changes these perceptions. Database administrators were surveyed on the perceptions of their database software vendor. Fulfilling commitments to software functionality was more strongly correlated with vendor reputation than on-time delivery of the software. Customer dependence on the vendor was not correlated with perceptions of vendor reputation and credibility. Thus, unlike other industries, it seems that vendors can use software delivery time preannouncements for competitive purposes with minimal concern for the impact on customers, provided the software ultimately delivers the features and functionality promised and is largely free of errors."	corporate reputation; signaling; software preannouncements; vaporware	Hoxmeier, JA	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS	https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000088450900006		115-139							2	Web of Science		Software preannouncements and their impact on customers' perceptions and vendor reputation	https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000088450900006	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	nan; References; Year; Bibtex; DOI

However, one of the critical challenges today is uncertainty inherent to every aspect of software development including requirement specifications, design, coding, and testing. In this paper, we propose a framework for uncertainty management in software engineering. The framework is used to model uncertainty inherent to software development activities and manage their consequences. The framework consists of four main phases: identification and prioritization, modeling and analysis, management and planning, and monitoring and evaluation. Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS)-based development is selected as an example to illustrate how the proposed framework is used in a simple but intuitive case study to represent uncertainty and manage its consequences.

111	TrustSE	Uncertainty Explicit Assessment of Off-the-Shelf Software: Selection of an Optimal Diverse Pair	Assessment of software COTS components is an essential part of component-based software development. Sub-optimal selection of components may lead to solutions with low quality. The assessment is based on incomplete knowledge about the COTS components themselves and other aspects, which may affect the choice such as the vendor's credentials, etc. We argue in favor of assessment methods in which uncertainty is explicitly represented (`uncertainty explicit' methods) using probability distributions. We have adapted a model (developed elsewhere by Littlewood, B. et al. (2000)) for assessment of a pair of COTS components to take account of the fault (bug) logs that might be available for the COTS components being assessed.

144	TrustSE	Categorizing bugs with social networks: a case study on four open source software communities	Efficient bug triaging procedures are an important precondition for successful collaborative software engineering projects. Triaging bugs can become a laborious task particularly in open source software (OSS) projects with a large base of comparably inexperienced part-time contributors. In this paper, we propose an efficient and practical method to identify valid bug reports which a) refer to an actual software bug, b) are not duplicates and c) contain enough information to be processed right away. Our classification is based on nine measures to quantify the social embeddedness of bug reporters in the collaboration network. We demonstrate its applicability in a case study, using a comprehensive data set of more than 700,000 bug reports obtained from the Bugzilla installation of four major OSS communities, for a period of more than ten years. For those projects that exhibit the lowest fraction of valid bug reports, we find that the bug reporters' position in the collaboration network is a strong indicator for the quality of bug reports. Based on this finding, we develop an automated classification scheme that can easily be integrated into bug tracking platforms and analyze its performance in the considered OSS communities. A support vector machine (SVM) to identify valid bug reports based on the nine measures yields a precision of up to 90.3\% with an associated recall of 38.9\%. With this, we significantly improve the results obtained in previous case studies for an automated early identification of bugs that are eventually fixed. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential of using quantitative measures of social organization in collaborative software engineering. It also opens a broad perspective for the integration of social awareness in the design of support infrastructures.

146	TrustSE	Core and Periphery in Free/Libre and Open Source Software Team Communications	"The concept of the core group of developers is important and often discussed in empirical studies of FLOSS projects. This paper examines the question, ""how does one empirically distinguish the core?"" Being able to identify the core members of a FLOSS development project is important because many of the processes necessary for successful projects likely involve core members differently than peripheral members, so analyses that mix the two groups will likely yield invalid results. We compare 3 analysis approaches to identify the core: the named list of developers, a Bradford's law analysis that takes as the core the most frequent contributors and a social network analysis of the interaction pattern that identifies the core in a core-and-periphery structure. We apply these measures to the interactions around bug fixing for 116 SourceForge projects. The 3 techniques identify different individuals as core members; examination of which individuals are identified leads to suggestions for refining the measures. All 3 measures though suggest that the core of FLOSS projects is a small fraction of the total number of contributors."

156	TrustSE	The Mysteries of Open Source Software: Black and White and Red All Over?	Open Source Software (OSS) has attracted enormous media and research attention since the term was coined in February 1998. The concept itself is founded on the paradoxical premise that software source code-the 'crown jewels' for many proprietary software companies-should be provided freely to anyone who wishes to see it. Given this fundamental initial paradox, it is perhaps hardly surprising that the OSS concept is characterised by contradictions, paradoxes and tensions throughout. In this paper we focus specifically on the following issues in relation to OSS: the cathedral v. bazaar development approach; collectivism v. individualism, the bitter strife within the OSS community itself (OSS v. OSS), and between OSS and the Free Software Foundation (OSS v. FSF); whether OSS represents a paradigm shift in the software industry; whether the software is truly open-the Berkeley Conundrum, as we have termed it here; whether OSS truly is high quality software; and whether OSS is a 'one size fits all,' representing the future model for all software development.

157	TrustSE	Trust engineering:rejecting the tyranny of the weakest link	In 2002 [1], the National Security Agency's Information Assurance Research Group coined the term,trust engineering, to describe a methodology for making use of software of uncertain provenance in mission-critical systems. Today, the loss of control that made software so hard to trust then applies to the rest of the supply chain as well. The discipline we described in the internal paper, <u>Trust-engineering: An Assurance Strategy for Software-based Systems</u>, no longer seems heretical today, even at NSA. Ten years later, we revisit the principles of trust engineering, compare the mechanisms available to us today with the practices of the past, and explore the construction of systems that are stronger than their weakest link.	assurance; composition; containment; defense in depth; isolation; layered; monitoring; moving target defense; provenance; supply chain; trust; trust engineering; virtualization	Susan D.

171	TrustSE	Predicting fault incidence using software change history	This paper is an attempt to understand the processes by which software ages. We define code to be aged or decayed if its structure makes it unnecessarily difficult to understand or change and we measure the extent of decay by counting the number of faults in code in a period of time. Using change management data from a very large, long-lived software system, we explore the extent to which measurements from the change history are successful in predicting the distribution over modules of these incidences of faults. In general, process measures based on the change history are more useful in predicting fault rates than product metrics of the code: For instance, the number of times code has been changed is a better indication of how many faults it will contain than is its length. We also compare the fault rates of code of various ages, finding that if a module is, on the average, a year older than an otherwise similar module, the older module will have roughly a third fewer faults. Our most successful model measures the fault potential of a module as the sum of contributions from all of the times the module has been changed, with large, recent changes receiving the most weight.

172	TrustSE	Convicting exploitable software vulnerabilities: An efficient input provenance based approach	Software vulnerabilities are the root cause of a wide range of attacks. Existing vulnerability scanning tools are able to produce a set of suspects. However, they often suffer from a high false positive rate. Convicting a suspect and vindicating false positives are mostly a highly demanding manual process, requiring a certain level of understanding of the software. This limitation significantly thwarts the application of these tools by system administrators or regular users who are concerned about security but lack of understanding of, or even access to, the source code. It is often the case that even developers are reluctant to inspect/fix these numerous suspects unless they are convicted by evidence. In this paper, we propose a lightweight dynamic approach which generates evidence for various security vulnerabilities in software, with the goal of relieving the manual procedure. It is based on data lineage tracing, a technique that associates each execution point precisely with a set of relevant input values. These input values can be mutated by an offline analysis to generate exploits. We overcome the efficiency challenge by using Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD). Our tool successfully generates exploits for all the known vulnerabilities we studied. We also use it to uncover a number of new vulnerabilities, proved by evidence.

175	TrustSE	Organizational adoption of open source software: barriers and remedies	"IntroductionPerhaps the business case for adopting open source software is an easy sell. After all, the software is free, and can be simply downloaded from the Internet and installed or customized as needed. Organizations interested in reducing the licensing fees of proprietary software, while also avoiding the penalties and legal liabilities associated with their illegal use, can definitely consider open source software a plausible alternative. However, less obvious than the cost savings but equally important are the barriers (""hidden costs"") of adopting open source software.Open source software has created considerable excitement in the business world over the last decade. These applications, designed by groups of volunteer software developers, have the potential to break the current dominance of proprietary software and restrictive licenses for many business applications, reduce software development time and improve software quality, and most importantly, bring much needed software applications within the reach of individuals and small businesses, who cannot otherwise afford such software. Further, unlike proprietary software, open source software applications make their source code available for free, which can be customized to fit the unique needs of specific organizations.Many organizations have caught on to open source software and realized significant cost savings in technology expenditure as a result. For instance, Cendant Travel Distribution Services replaced a $100 million mainframe system with a $2.5 million system running on 144 Linux servers. Amazon.com cut its technology expenditure from $71 million to $54 million by switching to open source applications. Sabre Holdings saved tens of millions of dollars by adopting MySQL, an open source database product. Though the basic open source software is free, the prospect of paid ancillary products and services such as hardware and consulting has motivated many erstwhile proprietary technology vendors such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Sun Microsystems to embrace open source software and offer value-added services based on such software.Table 1 shows an estimated range of the current global market share of several of today's open source software applications. This table shows that though the open source market is large and growing for some application domains such as Web server (such as Apache), server operating systems (such as Linux Server), database server (such as MySQL), electronic mail client (such as Sendmail), and Internet browser (such as Firefox), it is lagging behind its proprietary counterparts in other domains such as client operating systems (such as Linux Workstation), office productivity software (such as OpenOffice), and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. This pattern suggests that there may be significant barriers to open source software adoption among some sectors of the user populations.It is widely believed that proprietary software vendors often use fear, uncertainty and doubt to undermine and cut the market potential of their open source competitors. The objective of this paper is to reduce that uncertainty via a candid discussion of the barriers confronting open source software adoption and potential remedies to those barriers. These barriers and their remedies, summarized in Table 2, are discussed in detail."		Nagy, Del; Yassin, Areej M.; Bhattacherjee, Anol	Commun.

This pattern suggests that there may be significant barriers to open source software adoption among some sectors of the user populations.It is widely believed that proprietary software vendors often use fear, uncertainty and doubt to undermine and cut the market potential of their open source competitors. The objective of this paper is to reduce that uncertainty via a candid discussion of the barriers confronting open source software adoption and potential remedies to those barriers. These barriers and their remedies, summarized in Table 2, are discussed in detail.},

181	TrustSE	The extent of orphan vulnerabilities from code reuse in open source software	Motivation: A key premise of open source software is the ability to copy code to other open source projects (white-box reuse). Such copying accelerates development of new projects, but the code flaws in the original projects, such as vulnerabilities, may also spread even if fixed in the projects from where the code was appropriated. The extent of the spread of vulnerabilities through code reuse, the potential impact of such spread, or avenues for mitigating risk of these secondary vulnerabilities has not been studied in the context of a nearly complete collection of open source code.Aim: We aim to find ways to detect the white-box reuse induced vulnerabilities, determine how prevalent they are, and explore how they may be addressed.Method: We rely on World of Code infrastructure that provides a curated and cross-referenced collection of nearly all open source software to conduct a case study of a few known vulnerabilities. To conduct our case study we develop a tool, VDiOS, to help identify and fix white-box-reuse-induced vulnerabilities that have been already patched in the original projects (orphan vulnerabilities).Results: We find numerous instances of orphan vulnerabilities even in currently active and in highly popular projects (over 1K stars). Even apparently inactive projects are still publicly available for others to use and spread the vulnerability further. The often long delay in fixing orphan vulnerabilities even in highly popular projects increases the chances of it spreading to new projects. We provided patches to a number of project maintainers and found that only a small percentage accepted and applied the patch. We hope that VDiOS will lead to further study and mitigation of risks from orphan vulnerabilities and other orphan code flaws.

207	TrustSE	Trust Management Mechanism in IoV based on Bayesian classification	The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) significantly enhances the perception of the traffic environment and facilitates information exchange among vehicles, thereby bolstering transportation safety. Nevertheless, the intricate nature of traffic scenes, the swift movement of vehicles and the dynamic nature of the vehicle network's topology present challenges in guaranteeing the reliability of shared messages among vehicles. The intricacy of the situation additionally poses challenges for vehicles in evaluating the reliability of received messages, creating substantial potential for traffic accidents. Therefore, this article proposes an IoV trust management mechanism based on Bayesian classification, which designs a complete vehicle trust value calculation scheme. The verification of messages received from neighboring vehicles is carried out using the Bayesian inference model, which can effectively detect vehicles sending malicious information. After the verification results, rating parameters are produced for every source vehicle of the messages. Ultimately, the trust value of the vehicle is calibrated and penalized based on these rating parameters. The vehicle uploads rating parameters to the RSU, which calculates the trust value of the relevant vehicles. By excluding vehicles with low trust values, the cooperation success rate among vehicles within the network has risen from 65\% to approximately 70\%.

209	TrustSE	Predicting Trustworthiness for Component Software	Trust has been recognized as an important factor for component software. In this paper, we propose a methodology to predict trustworthiness of a software component for downloading and execution. The methodology is based on a trust model of software component, which indicates the component's asserted performance and requirements for achieving the performance. Through evaluating the related trust models, the proposed methodology can predict the trustworthiness of the software components.

216	TrustSE	Quantitative studies in software release planning under risk and resource constraints	Delivering software in an incremental fashion implicitly reduces many of the risks associated with delivering large software projects. However, adopting a process, where requirements are delivered in releases means decisions have to be made on which requirements should be delivered in which release. This paper describes a method called EVOLVE+, based on a genetic algorithm and aimed at the evolutionary planning of incremental software development. The method is initially evaluated using a sample project. The evaluation involves an investigation of the tradeoff relationship between risk and the overall benefit. The link to empirical research is two-fold: firstly, our model is based on interaction with industry and randomly generated data for effort and risk of requirements. The results achieved this way are the first step for a more comprehensive evaluation using real-world data. Secondly, we try to approach uncertainty of data by additional computational effort providing more insight into the problem solutions: (i) effort estimates are considered to be stochastic variables following a given probability function; (ii) instead of offering just one solution, the L-best (L > 1) solutions are determined. This provides support in finding the most appropriate solution, reflecting implicit preferences and constraints of the actual decision-maker. Stability intervals are given to indicate the validity of solutions and to allow the problem parameters to be changed without adversely affecting the optimality of the solution.

It focuses on exploring how FOSS is developed and evolved based on an extensive review of a set of empirical studies of FOSSD projects that articulate different levels of analysis. These characterize what has been analyzed in FOSSD studies across levels that examine (i) why individuals participate; (ii) resources and capabilities supporting development activities; (iii) how cooperation, coordination, and control are realized in projects; (iv) alliance formation and inter-project social networking; (v) FOSS as a multi-project software ecosystem, and (vi) FOSS as a social movement. Next, there is a discussion of limitations and constraints in the FOSSD studies so far. Last, attention shifts to identifying emerging opportunities for future FOSSD studies that can give rise to the development of new software engineering tools or techniques, as well as to new empirical studies of software development.	empirical studies;  free software;  open source software;  socio-technical relationships;  software development practices	Scacchi, Walt	ESEC-FSE '07: Proceedings of the the 6th joint meeting of the European software engineering conference and the ACM SIGSOFT symposium on The foundations of software engineering	https://doi.org/10.1145/1287624.1287689		459-468	"@inproceedings{10.1145/1287624.1287689,

226	TrustSE	A market-based approach to software evolution	"Software correctness has bedeviled the field of computer science since its inception. Software complexity has increased far more quickly than our ability to control it, reaching sizes that are many orders of magnitude beyond the reach of formal or automated verification techniques.We propose a new paradigm for evaluating ""correctness"" based on a rich market ecosystem in which coalitions of users bid for features and fixes. Developers, testers, bug reporters, and analysts share in the rewards for responding to those bids. In fact, we suggest that the entire software development process can be driven by a disintermediated market-based mechanism driven by the desires of users and the capabilities of developers.The abstract, unspecifiable, and unknowable notion of absolute correctness is then replaced by quantifiable notions of correctness demand (the sum of bids for bugs) and correctness potential (the sum of the available profit for fixing those bugs). We then sketch the components of a market design intended to identify bugs, elicit demand for fixing bugs, and source workers for fixing bugs. The ultimate goal is to achieve a more appropriate notion of correctness, in which market forces drive software towards a correctness equilibrium in which all bugs for which there is enough value, and with low enough cost to fix, are fixed."	markets;  mechanism design;  software correctness	Bacon, David F.; Chen, Yiling; Parkes, David; Rao, Malvika	OOPSLA '09: Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGPLAN conference companion on Object oriented programming systems languages and applications	https://doi.org/10.1145/1639950.1640066		973-980	"@inproceedings{10.1145/1639950.1640066,

230	TrustSE	Vulnerability Scrying Method for Software Vulnerability Discovery Prediction Without a Vulnerability Database	Predicting software vulnerability discovery trends can help improve secure deployment of software applications and facilitate backup provisioning, disaster recovery, diversity planning, and maintenance scheduling. Vulnerability discovery models (VDMs) have been studied in the literature as a means to capture the underlying stochastic process. Based on the VDMs, a few vulnerability prediction schemes have been proposed. Unfortunately, all these schemes suffer from the same weaknesses: they require a large amount of historical vulnerability data from a database (hence they are not applicable to a newly released software application), their precision depends on the amount of training data, and they have significant amount of error in their estimates. In this work, we propose vulnerability scrying, a new paradigm for vulnerability discovery prediction based on code properties. Using compiler-based static analysis of a codebase, we extract code properties such as code complexity (cyclomatic complexity), and more importantly code quality (compliance with secure coding rules), from the source code of a software application. Then we propose a stochastic model which uses code properties as its parameters to predict vulnerability discovery. We have studied the impact of code properties on the vulnerability discovery trends by performing static analysis on the source code of four real-world software applications. We have used our scheme to predict vulnerability discovery in three other software applications. The results show that even though we use no historical data in our prediction, vulnerability scrying can predict vulnerability discovery with better precision and less divergence over time.

237	TrustSE	Organizational adoption of open source software: barriers and remedies	"IntroductionPerhaps the business case for adopting open source software is an easy sell. After all, the software is free, and can be simply downloaded from the Internet and installed or customized as needed. Organizations interested in reducing the licensing fees of proprietary software, while also avoiding the penalties and legal liabilities associated with their illegal use, can definitely consider open source software a plausible alternative. However, less obvious than the cost savings but equally important are the barriers (""hidden costs"") of adopting open source software.Open source software has created considerable excitement in the business world over the last decade. These applications, designed by groups of volunteer software developers, have the potential to break the current dominance of proprietary software and restrictive licenses for many business applications, reduce software development time and improve software quality, and most importantly, bring much needed software applications within the reach of individuals and small businesses, who cannot otherwise afford such software.

    abstract = {IntroductionPerhaps the business case for adopting open source software is an easy sell. After all, the software is free, and can be simply downloaded from the Internet and installed or customized as needed. Organizations interested in reducing the licensing fees of proprietary software, while also avoiding the penalties and legal liabilities associated with their illegal use, can definitely consider open source software a plausible alternative. However, less obvious than the cost savings but equally important are the barriers (""hidden costs"") of adopting open source software.Open source software has created considerable excitement in the business world over the last decade. These applications, designed by groups of volunteer software developers, have the potential to break the current dominance of proprietary software and restrictive licenses for many business applications, reduce software development time and improve software quality, and most importantly, bring much needed software applications within the reach of individuals and small businesses, who cannot otherwise afford such software. Further, unlike proprietary software, open source software applications make their source code available for free, which can be customized to fit the unique needs of specific organizations.Many organizations have caught on to open source software and realized significant cost savings in technology expenditure as a result.

A real-valued genetic algorithm is used to calculate the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters in combinational models for solving the problem that the traditional maximum likelihood estimation algorithms cannot give parameter estimates when fitting some data sets. Then, five published failure data sets, most of which have non-steady growth trend, are selected to verify the effectiveness of our models. The results show that the MSE of our models are always lower. It reduces at least 3.12\%, and at most 69.31\% compared with the single optimal model. These indicate that our method is feasible and effective.

With the emergence and popularity growth of social Q&A sites such as the StackExchange network (e.g., StackOverflow), this is beginning to change. Such sites offer different socio-technical incentives to their participants than mailing lists do, e.g., rich web environments to store and manage content collaboratively, or a place to showcase their knowledge and expertise more vividly to peers or potential recruiters. A key difference between StackExchange and mailing lists is gamification, i.e., StackExchange participants compete to obtain reputation points and badges. In this paper, we use a case study of R (a widely-used tool for data analysis) to investigate how mailing list participation has evolved since the launch of StackExchange. Our main contribution is the assembly of a joint data set from the two sources, in which participants in both the texttt{r-help} mailing list and StackExchange are identifiable. This permits their activities to be linked across the two resources and also over time. With this data set we found that user support activities show a strong shift away from texttt{r-help}. In particular, mailing list experts are migrating to StackExchange, where their behaviour is different. First, participants active both on texttt{r-help} and on StackExchange are more active than those who focus exclusively on only one of the two. Second, they provide faster answers on StackExchange than on texttt{r-help}, suggesting they are motivated by the emph{gamified} environment. To our knowledge, our study is the first to directly chart the changes in behaviour of specific contributors as they migrate into gamified environments, and has important implications for knowledge management in software engineering.	crowdsourced knowledge;  gamification.;  mailing lists;  open source;  social q&a	Vasilescu, Bogdan; Serebrenik, Alexander; Devanbu, Prem; Filkov, Vladimir	CSCW '14: Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work & social computing	https://doi.org/10.1145/2531602.2531659		342-354	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2531602.2531659,

Migrating from traditional software to Cloud enables on-going revenue for software providers. However, in order to deliver hosted services to customers, SaaS companies have to either maintain their own hardware or rent it from infrastructure providers. This requirement means that SaaS providers will incur extra costs. In order to minimize the cost of resources, it is also important to satisfy a minimum service level to customers. Therefore, this paper proposes resource allocation algorithms for SaaS providers who want to minimize infrastructure cost and SLA violations. Our proposed algorithms are designed in a way to ensure that Saas providers are able to manage the dynamic change of customers, mapping customer requests to infrastructure level parameters and handling heterogeneity of Virtual Machines. We take into account the customers' Quality of Service parameters such as response time, and infrastructure level parameters such as service initiation time. This paper also presents an extensive evaluation study to analyze and demonstrate that our proposed algorithms minimize the SaaS provider's cost and the number of SLA violations in a dynamic resource sharing Cloud environment.

288	TrustSE	An Empirical Analysis of the Impact of Software Vulnerability Announcements on Firm Stock Price	Security defects in software cost millions of dollars to firms in terms of downtime, disruptions, and confidentiality breaches. However, the economic implications of these defects for software vendors are not well understood. Lack of legal liability and the presence of switching costs and network externalities may protect software vendors from incurring significant costs in the event of a vulnerability announcement, unlike such industries as auto and pharmaceuticals, which have been known to suffer significant loss in market value in the event of a defect announcement. Although research in software economics has studied firms' incentives to improve overall quality, there have not been any studies which show that software vendors have an incentive to invest in building more secure software. The objectives of this paper are twofold. 1) We examine how a software vendor's market value changes when a vulnerability is announced. 2) We examine how firm and vulnerability characteristics mediate the change in the market value of a vendor. We collect data from leading national newspapers and industry sources, such as the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), by searching for reports on published software vulnerabilities. We show that vulnerability announcements lead to a negative and significant change in a software vendor's market value. In our sample, on average, a vendor loses around 0.6 percent value in stock price when a vulnerability is reported. We find that a software vendor loses more market share if the market is competitive or if the vendor is small. To provide further insight, we use the information content of the disclosure announcement to classify vulnerabilities into various types. We find that the change in stock price is more negative if the vendor fails to provide a patch at the time of disclosure. Also, more severe flaws have a significantly greater impact. Our analysis provides many interesting implications for software vendors as well as policy makers.

The classical methods of estimating reliability are shown to lead to exorbitant amounts of testing when applied to life-critical software. Reliability growth models are examined and also shown to be incapable of overcoming the need for excessive amounts of testing. The key assumption of software fault tolerance-separately programmed versions fail independently-is shown to be problematic. This assumption cannot be justified by experimentation in the ultrareliability region, and subjective arguments in its favor are not sufficiently strong to justify it as an axiom. Also, the implications of the recent multiversion software experiments support this affirmation.<

Metrics can be an effective tool for companies and information security professionals to measure, control, and improve their security control and mechanisms. However, common security metrics are often qualitative, subjective, and informal in the sense that they are lacking formal models and automated support. This paper discussed our work on temporal metrics for software vulnerabilities based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System 2.0. A mathematical model is provided to calculate the severity and risk of a vulnerability, which is time dependent including exploitability, remediation level, and report confidence attributes of an information asset in a computing environment.

In contrast to industry, where reviews are typically assigned to specific individuals, changes are broadcast to hundreds of potentially interested stakeholders. Despite concerns that reviews may be ignored, or that discussions will deadlock because too many uninformed stakeholders are involved, we find that this approach works well in practice. In this paper, we describe an empirical study to investigate the mechanisms and behaviours that developers use to find code changes they are competent to review. We also explore how stakeholders interact with one another during the review process. We manually examine hundreds of reviews across five high profile OSS projects. Our findings provide insights into the simple, community-wide techniques that developers use to effectively manage large quantities of reviews. The themes that emerge from our study are enriched and validated by interviewing long-serving core developers.	peer review;  open source software;  grounded theory;  case studies	Rigby, Peter C.; Storey, Margaret-Anne	ICSE '11: Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Software Engineering	https://doi.org/10.1145/1985793.1985867		541-550	"@inproceedings{10.1145/1985793.1985867,

304	TrustSE	Understanding the sources of variation in software inspections	"In a previous experiment, we determined how various changes in three structural elements of the software inspection process (team size and the number and sequencing of sessions) altered effectiveness and interval. Our results showed that such changes did not significantly influence the defect detection rate, but that certain combinations of changes dramatically increased the inspection interval. We also observed a large amount of unexplained variance in the data, indicating that other factors must be affecting inspection performance. The nature and extent of these other factors now have to be determined to ensure that they had not biased our earlier results. Also, identifying these other factors might suggest additional ways to improve the efficiency of inspections. Acting on the hypothesis that the ""inputs"" into the inspection process (reviewers, authors, and code units) were significant sources of variation, we modeled their effects on inspection performance. We found that they were responsible for much more variation in detect detection than was process structure. This leads us to conclude that better defect detection techniques, not better process structures, are the key to improving inspection effectiveness. The combined effects of process inputs and process structure on the inspection interval accounted for only a small percentage of the variance in inspection interval. Therefore, there must be other factors which need to be identified."	statistical models;  software process;  software inspection;  empirical studies	Porter, Adam; Siy, Harvey; Mockus, Audris; Votta, Lawrence	ACM Trans.

However, data alone can become obsolete if the interactivity of software required to interpret the data is lost. Virtual machines (VMs) may preserve interactivity however do so at the cost of obscuring the nature of what lies within.

Thus, the system can track the exact components inside VMs without storing the machines themselves, allowing software to be repeatably built and executed. For Occam to recreate VMs, it needs to know exactly what software was used within. Through this tracking, such software can even be modified and rebuilt. Occam keeps track of all such components in manifests, allowing anybody to know exactly what is in each VM, and the origins of each component.

However, managing many configurations is difficult because the configuration space is combinatorial in size.We introduce Spack, a tool used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to manage this complexity.

However, this information is becoming of major interest, especially ---but not only--- because of the growth in the number of companies for which FOSS has become relevant for their business strategy. In this paper we present a novel approach to estimate effort by considering data from source code management repositories. We apply our model to the OpenStack project, a FOSS project with more than 1,000 authors, in which several tens of companies cooperate. Based on data from its repositories and together with the input from a survey answered by more than 100 developers, we show that the model offers a simple, but sound way of obtaining software development estimations with bounded margins of error.

325	TrustSE	Using innovative instructions to create trustworthy software solutions	Software developers face a number of challenges when creating applications that attempt to keep important data confidential. Even with diligent attention paid to correct software design and implementation practices, secrets can still be exposed through a single flaw in any of the privileged code on the platform, code which may have been written by thousands of developers from hundreds of organizations throughout the world. Intel is developing innovative security technology which provides the ability for software developers to maintain control of the security of sensitive code and data by creating trusted domains within applications to protect critical information during execution and at rest. This paper will describe how this technology has been effectively used in lab exercises to protect private information in applications including enterprise rights management, video chat, trusted financial transactions, and others.

Intel is developing innovative security technology which provides the ability for software developers to maintain control of the security of sensitive code and data by creating trusted domains within applications to protect critical information during execution and at rest. This paper will describe how this technology has been effectively used in lab exercises to protect private information in applications including enterprise rights management, video chat, trusted financial transactions, and others.

326	TrustSE	A Software Component Quality Model: A Preliminary Evaluation	Component-based software development is becoming more generalized, representing a considerable market for the software industry. The perspective of reduced development costs and shorter life cycles acts as a motivation for this expansion. However, several technical issues remain unsolved before software component's industry reaches the maturity exhibited by other component industries. Problems such as the component selection by their integrators and the uncertain quality of third-party developed components, bring new challenges to the software engineering community. By the other hand, the software components certification area is still immature and further research is needed in order to obtain well-defined standards for certification. In this way, we aim to propose a component quality model, describing consistent and well-defined characteristics, quality attributes and related metrics for the components evaluation. A preliminary evaluation to analyze the results of using the component quality model proposed is also presented	Software quality; Certification; Computer industry; Programming; Software engineering; Software standards; Mathematical model; Predictive models; Costs; Assembly; Model Quality; Software Components; Quality Attributes; Software Engineering; Related Metrics; Objective Of This Study; Null Hypothesis; Alternative Hypothesis; Development Of Applications; Quality Characteristics; Kind Of Information; Target Market; Components In Order; Considerable Information; Software Product; Market Characteristics; Technological Quality; Boolean Variable; Ability Of Components	Alexandre Alvaro; Eduardo Santana De Almeida; Silvio Lemos Meira	32nd EUROMICRO Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (EUROMICRO'06)	https://doi.org/10.1109/EUROMICRO.2006.13	"1.C.W.

350	TrustSE	STRAM: Measuring the Trustworthiness of Computer-Based Systems	Various system metrics have been proposed for measuring the quality of computer-based systems, such as dependability and security metrics for estimating their performance and security characteristics. As computer-based systems grow in complexity with many subsystems or components, measuring their quality in multiple dimensions is a challenging task. In this work, we tackle the problem of measuring the quality of computer-based systems based on the four key attributes of trustworthiness we developed: security, trust, resilience, and agility. In addition to conducting a systematic survey on metrics, measurements, attributes of metrics, and associated ontologies, we propose a system-level trustworthiness metric framework that accommodates four submetrics, called STRAM (<u>S</u>ecurity, <u>T</u>rust, <u>R</u>esilience, and <u>A</u>gility <u>M</u>etrics). The proposed STRAM framework offers a hierarchical ontology structure where each submetric is defined as a sub-ontology. Moreover, this work proposes developing and incorporating metrics describing key assessment tools, including vulnerability assessment, risk assessment, and red teaming, to provide additional evidence in the measurement and quality of trustworthy systems. We further discuss how assessment tools are related to measuring the quality of computer-based systems and the limitations of the state-of-the-art metrics and measurements. Finally, we suggest future research directions for system-level metrics research toward measuring fundamental attributes of the quality of computer-based systems and improving the current metric and measurement methodologies.	trustworthiness;  trust;  security;  resilience;  metric;  agility;  Measurement	Cho, Jin-Hee; Xu, Shouhuai; Hurley, Patrick M.; Mackay, Matthew; Benjamin, Trevor; Beaumont, Mark	ACM Comput.

We performed a multiple case study of three software ecosystems with different tooling and philosophies toward change, Eclipse, R/CRAN, and Node.js/npm, to understand how developers make decisions about change and change-related costs and what practices, tooling, and policies are used. We found that all three ecosystems differ substantially in their practices and expectations toward change and that those differences can be explained largely by different community values in each ecosystem. Our results illustrate that there is a large design space in how to build an ecosystem, its policies and its supporting infrastructure; and there is value in making community values and accepted tradeoffs explicit and transparent in order to resolve conflicts and negotiate change-related costs.	semantic versioning;  Software ecosystems;  Qualitative research;  Dependency management;  Collaboration	"Bogart, Christopher; K\""{a}stner, Christian; Herbsleb, James; Thung, Ferdian"	FSE 2016: Proceedings of the 2016 24th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Foundations of Software Engineering	https://doi.org/10.1145/2950290.2950325		109-120	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2950290.2950325,

353	TrustSE	Overview of Root Causes of Software Vulnerabilities - Technical and User-Side Perspectives	Software security is equally a shared responsibility of technical experts and clients who deploys the system. When a software receives security assurance upon its product release, security validation of the software is assured. Security compromise may take place by luring authenticate users to exploit the vulnerabilities persists in the system.Vulnerabilities emerging from user side also plays a significant role in determining security assurance of the system. Depending upon the level of software attack surface, potential vulnerability can be injected into the system. Therefore the root causes of software vulnerabilities cannot merely contributed to the technical aspects of mitigation techniques. These increased level of requirements took security experts to a spectrum where users' improper or insecure practices should also be counted while securing a software system. In this paper, I explain about various factors that includes technical and social perspectives that should be taken into consideration with a proper balance to secure a software system. Based on thorough literature review, an in-depth explanation on various information system vulnerabilities and recommended techniques to reduce the attack surfaces of those vulnerabilities are also provided.

As with commercial off-the-shelf software, project developers acquire open source components from a vendor (or a community) and use them ""as is"" or with minor modifications. Although they have access to the component's source code, developers aren't required to do anything with it. If the component's community is large and active, the adopting organization can expect frequent software updates, reasonable quality assurance, responsive hug fixes, and good technical support. Also, having freely available source code addresses two typical concerns with using COTS components: unknown implementation quality and long-term vendor support."

375	TrustSE	Measuring software library stability through historical version analysis	Backward compatibility is a major concern for any library developer. In this paper, we evaluate how stable a set of frequently used third-party libraries is in terms of method removals, implementation change, the ratio of change in old methods to change in new ones and the percentage of new methods in each snapshot. We provide a motivating example of a commercial company which demonstrates several issues associated with the usage of third-party libraries. To obtain dependencies from software systems we developed a framework which extracts dependencies from Maven build files and which analyzes system and library code. We propose four metrics which provide different insights in the implementation and interface stability of a library. The usage frequency of library methods is utilized as a weight in the final metric and is obtained from a dataset of more than 2300 snapshots of 140 industrial Java systems. We finally describe three scenarios and an example of the application of our metrics.

385	TrustSE	Trustworthiness Evaluation and Testing of Open Source Components	The use of Open Source Components (OSCs) is rapidly increasing in software systems. One of the biggest obstacles for the use of OSCs is the fact that the software integrators can not be sure of the quality of the components. Thus, it is the responsibility of the integrators to perform the quality evaluation. When building products using OSCs, the integrators should have a clear method and tools that facilitate and automate the evaluation work. Our contribution is a method and tooling for trustworthiness evaluation and testing of OSCs. The method provides clear guidelines to assist the integrators to perform the evaluation in their own software development environment. The tooling assists in the technical trustworthiness evaluation, containing tools for reliability analysis and testing. The tools are independent, co-operating in the open source context.

Building upon a previously established security architecture tailored for the railway sector, this work introduces significant enhancements that extend its applicability beyond the confines of any singular industry. Key advancements include the integration of a security heartbeat to augment safety monitoring, the implementation of a sophisticated secure update mechanism leveraging Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Enhanced Authorization (EA) policies, local Trusted Platform Module (TPM) based attestation, a cyber-resiliency watchdog in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) that detects compromised system components and triggers remediation actions, automated vulnerability scanning leveraging Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) logs to check against vulnerability databases, and a formal evaluation of system integrity reporting capabilities through remote attestation. Moreover, aiming for a universally adaptable framework, this paper proposes a reference architecture to accommodate various operational contexts. We use compartments--such as virtual machines, software containers, and RTOSes partitions--as a universal abstraction for system components, designed to be compatible with various real-time operating systemss (RTOSess), including the safety-certified PikeOS, the ACRN hypervisor, and beyond.

IntroductionGlobal Software Development (GSD) is increasingly becoming the normal practice in the software industry, readily evidenced by U.S. estimates that the value of the offshore software development market has increased 25-fold over the past 10 years, to the extent that one-quarter of U.S. spending on application development, integration and management services is expected to go off-shore according to recent predictions. There are many potential benefits that can arise from GSD. The most frequently cited one is that of reduced development costs due to the salary savings possible. Also, GSD can lead to reduced development duration due to greater time zone effectiveness as companies practice the so-called 'follow-the-sun' software development model. GSD also affords new opportunities for cross-site modularization of development work, potential access to a larger and better-skilled developer pool, and the possibility of greater innovation, learning and transfer of best practices. Finally, GSD can facilitate closer proximity to markets and customers.However, GSD also introduces a number of challenges in relation to communication, coordination and control of the development process. These arise due to the distances involved in three dimensions -- geographical, temporal, and socio-cultural (See Figure 1). As a consequence, much research and practice has focused on trying to find ways to overcome the GSD challenges identified in Figure 1. In the literature to date, the potential benefits of GSD are usually just mentioned very briefly, if they are mentioned at all, and the realization of these benefits seems to be more or less taken for granted. The primary focus instead is on how the problems inherent in GSD might be addressed. Here, we reverse this trend and focus instead on the benefits and the extent to which they are actually being realized in practice in three global companies practicing GSD.

423	TrustSE	Requirements engineering meets trust management - Model, methodology, and reasoning	The last years have seen a number of proposals to incorporate Security Engineering into mainstream Software Requirements Engineering. However, capturing trust and security requirements at an organizational level (as opposed to a design level) is still an open problem. This paper presents a formal framework for modeling and analyzing security and trust requirements. It extends the Tropos methodology, an agent-oriented software engineering methodology. The key intuition is that in modeling security and trust, we need to distinguish between the actors that manipulate resources, accomplish goals or execute tasks, and actors that own the resources or the goals. To analyze an organization and its information systems, we proceed in two steps. First, we built a trust model, determining the trust relationships among actors, and then we give a functional model, where we analyze the actual delegations against the trust model, checking whether an actor that offers a service is authorized to have it.The formal framework allows for the automatic verification of security and trust requirements by using a suitable delegation logic that can be mechanized within Datalog. To make the discussion more concrete, we illustrate the proposal with a Health Care case study.

425	TrustSE	Free/open source software development	The focus of this paper is to review what is known about free and open source software development (FOSSD) work practices, development processes, project and community dynamics, and other socio-technical relationships. It focuses on exploring how FOSS is developed and evolved based on an extensive review of a set of empirical studies of FOSSD projects that articulate different levels of analysis. These characterize what has been analyzed in FOSSD studies across levels that examine (i) why individuals participate; (ii) resources and capabilities supporting development activities; (iii) how cooperation, coordination, and control are realized in projects; (iv) alliance formation and inter-project social networking; (v) FOSS as a multi-project software ecosystem, and (vi) FOSS as a social movement. Next, there is a discussion of limitations and constraints in the FOSSD studies so far. Last, attention shifts to identifying emerging opportunities for future FOSSD studies that can give rise to the development of new software engineering tools or techniques, as well as to new empirical studies of software development.	empirical studies;  free software;  open source software;  socio-technical relationships;  software development practices	Scacchi, Walt	ESEC-FSE '07: Proceedings of the the 6th joint meeting of the European software engineering conference and the ACM SIGSOFT symposium on The foundations of software engineering	https://doi.org/10.1145/1287624.1287689		459-468	"@inproceedings{10.1145/1287624.1287689,

428	TrustSE	Updating Model of Software Component Trustworthiness Based on Users Feedback	The software trustworthiness measurement is one of the hot topics. Software component technology is the mainstream technology of software development. How to get the trustworthy degree of software component efficiently and accurately is a challenging issue for the component-based software development. Getting the trustworthy degree of software component needs many users' success cases. In this paper, we propose an updating model of software component trustworthiness. First, the trustworthy degree of the software component is computed based on users' feedback. Then, the weight of updating is determined by the number of users. Finally, the method of cluster different companies is based on the Euler distance. A case study shows that the method is reasonable and effective.

API callings, menu selections or requests are the familiar base elements of software behaviors, and different technologies are required to monitor and understand them. In information systems, it is necessary to insure that users' software behavior is trusted while processing. Client-Server mode is widely used in distributed computing system, the decision technology of trusted software behaviors from software of client meets the demand of forward defense in information systems. This paper puts forward the definition of software behavior and behavior set in client-server mode, software behavior is composed of requests from client, Request is the component of one or more software behaviors easy to be monitored. The expression of software behavior has been studied, and decision model of trusted software behavior has been built based on fuzzy matching algorithm, it can decide whether the processing software behavior is trusted or not.

We found that less than 1\% of packages directly use these mechanisms, but many more indirectly use them. Examining how developers apply these mechanisms reveals interesting usage patterns, such as cases where developers simplify their sandbox implementation.

451	TrustSE	Evaluation and Application of Bounded Generalized Pareto Analysis to Fault Distributions in Open Source Software	In general, one of the most important aspects of software development and project management is how to make predictions and assessments of quality and reliability for developed products. Project data usually will be systematically collected and analyzed during the process of software development. Practically, it would be helpful if developers could identify the most error-prone modules early so that they can optimize testing-resource allocation and increase fault detection effectiveness accordingly. In the past, many research studies revealed the applicability of the Pareto principle to software systems, and some of them reported that the Pareto distribution (PD) model can be used to predict the fault distribution of software. In this paper, a special form of the Generalized PD model, named the Bounded Generalized Pareto distribution (BGPD) model, is further proposed to investigate the fault distributions of Open Source Software (OSS). It can be seen that the BGPD model eliminates the issue which occurred in the classical PD model. Three methods of parameter estimation will be presented, and related experiments are performed based on real OSS failure data. Experimental results show that the BGPD model presents high fitness to the actual failure data of OSS. Finally, the possibility of using early limited fault data to predict the later software fault distribution is also studied. Numerical results indicate that the BGPD model can be trusted to consistently produce accurate estimates of fault predictions during the early stages of development. The findings can provide an effective foundation for managing the necessary activities of software development and testing.

This shift in software development brings along with it several challenges ranging from communication of information/knowledge, coordination and control of teams, activities adhering to goals and policies and artifacts adhering to quality, visibility, and management. With the dispersion of centralized control over software delivery to autonomous delivery organizations, the variety of processes and tools used turns transparency into opacity as autonomous teams use different software processes, tools, and metrics, leading to issues like ineffective compliance monitoring, friction prone coordination, and lack of provenance, and thereby trust. In this paper, we present a delivery governance framework based on distributed ledger technology that uses a notion of 'software telemetry' to record data from disparate delivery partners and enables compliance monitoring and adherence, provenance and traceability, transparency, and thereby trust.

458	TrustSE	Toward a Formalism for Conservative Claims about the Dependability of Software-Based Systems	"In recent work, we have argued for a formal treatment of confidence about the claims made in dependability cases for software-based systems. The key idea underlying this work is ""the inevitability of uncertainty"": It is rarely possible to assert that a claim about safety or reliability is true with certainty. Much of this uncertainty is epistemic in nature, so it seems inevitable that expert judgment will continue to play an important role in dependability cases. Here, we consider a simple case where an expert makes a claim about the probability of failure on demand (pfd) of a subsystem of a wider system and is able to express his confidence about that claim probabilistically. An important, but difficult, problem then is how such subsystem (claim, confidence) pairs can be propagated through a dependability case for a wider system, of which the subsystems are components. An informal way forward is to justify, at high confidence, a strong claim, and then, conservatively, only claim something much weaker: ""I'm 99 percent confident that the pfd is less than 10-5, so it's reasonable to be 100 percent confident that it is less than 10-3."" These conservative pfds of subsystems can then be propagated simply through the dependability case of the wider system. In this paper, we provide formal support for such reasoning."

460	TrustSE	Software reliability with architectural uncertainties	Architecture-based software reliability analysis can provide early identification of critical components which can then be targeted for cost-effective reliability improvement of the application. However, an important challenge in conducting this analysis early in the life cycle is that it is nearly impossible to estimate the architectural and component parameters with certainty. The issue of estimating software application reliability in the presence of uncertain component reliabilities has been addressed in the previous research. In this paper we consider the estimation of software reliability in the presence of architectural uncertainties. We present a methodology to estimate the confidence levels in the architectural parameters using limited testing or simulation data based on the theory of confidence intervals of the multinomial distribution. The sensitivity of the system reliability to uncertain architectural parameters can then be quantified by varying these parameters within their confidence intervals. The illustration of the methodology using a case study indicates that the impact of the uncertainty in a given architectural parameter on the overall application reliability is determined by the inherent branching behavior of the application and the component reliabilities.

462	TrustSE	Software reliability estimation under certainty: generalization of the method of moments	Traditionally, reliability models of component-based software systems compute the point estimate of system reliability by plugging point estimates of unknown parameters into the model. These models discard the uncertainty of the parameters, that is, do not attempt to answer the question how parameters uncertainties affect the estimates of system reliability. In this paper we focus on uncertainty analysis in software reliability based on method of moments. In particular, we present a generalization of our earlier work that allows us to consider the uncertainty in the operational profile (i.e., the way software is used) in addition to the uncertainty in components failure behavior (i.e., component reliabilities) considered earlier. The method of moments is an approximate analytical method that allows us to generate system reliability moments based on (1) the knowledge of software architecture reflected in the expression of system reliability as a function of component reliabilities and frequencies of control transfer between components, (2) estimates of the moments of components reliabilities, and (3) estimates of the moments of probabilities of control transfer between components. Further, we apply the method of moments on two case studies and discuss its advantages and disadvantages.

A definition of projects collaborative relationship has been presented, and a projects collaborative network model is constructed. By mining and analyzing more than 10000 projects from sourceforge.net, we find that the projects collaborative relationship of software has a great impact on software trustworthiness. The number of project's collaborative project and the proportion of project's participants, who also join in other projects, are mostly important factors of projects collaborative network.

469	TrustSE	Visibility & Control: Addressing Supply Chain Challenges to Trustworthy Software-Enabled Things	"Software is playing a pivotal role in most enterprises, whether they realize it or not, and with the proliferation of Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) and other cyber/physical systems across our society and critical infrastructure and our collective love affair with automation, optimization, and ""smart"" devices, the role of these types of systems is only going to increase. This talk addresses the myriad of issues that underlie unsafe, insecure, and unreliable software and provides the insights of the Industrial Internet Consortium and other government and industry efforts on how to conquer them and pave the way to a marketplace of trustworthy software-enabled connected things.As the experience of several sectors has shown, the dependence on connected software needs to be met with a strong understanding of the risks to the overall trustworthiness of our software-based capabilities that we, our enterprises, and our world utilize. In many of these new connected systems issues of safety, reliability, and resilience rival or dominate concerns for security and privacy, the long-time focus of many in the IT world. Without a scalable and efficient method for managing these risks so our enterprises can continue to benefit from these advancements that powers our military, commercial industries, cities, and homes to new levels of efficiency, versatility, and cost effectiveness we face the potential for harm, death, and destructiveness.In such a marketplace, creating, exchanging, and integrating components that are trustworthy as well as entering into value-chain relationships with trustworthy partners and service suppliers will be common if we can provide a method for explicitly defining what is meant by the word trustworthy. The approach being pursued by these groups for applying Software Assurance to these systems and their Supply Chains by leveraging Structured Assurance Cases, Software Bill of Materials (the focus of this paper), and secure development practices applied..."

472	TrustSE	Trust Trade-off Analysis for Security Requirements Engineering	Security requirements often have implicit assumptions about trust relationships among actors. The more actors trust each other, the less stringent the security requirements are likely to be. Trust always involves the risk of mistrust; hence, trust implies a trade-off: gaining some benefits from depending on a second party in trade for getting exposed to security and privacy risks. When trust assumptions are implicit, these trust trade-offs are made implicitly and in an ad-hoc way. By taking advantage of agent- and goal-oriented analysis, we propose a method for discovering trade-offs that trust relationships bring. This method aims to help the analyst select among alternative dependency relationships by making explicit trust trade-offs. We propose a simple algorithm for making the trade-offs in a way that reaches a balance between costs and benefits.

474	TrustSE	Consumers' Trust Maintenance: From the Perspective of Knowledge-Based and Identification-Based Trust	Trust changes and develops gradually. How to maintain and preserve trust relationship is the key problem to solve as long as initial trust is build. From the perspective of knowledge-based and identification-based trust, this article focuses on trust maintenance and its impact mechanism after transaction. Firstly, based on related literature, this paper constructs a research model of trust maintenance mechanism. Then data are gathered by the method of questionnaire. Finally, the model and hypotheses are tested by Structured Equation Model software. The results show that post-transaction trust contains knowledge-based trust and identification-based trust. Moreover, the model reveals that the former positively affects the latter. Besides, it has been confirmed that security and privacy protection and service quality affect two types of trust respectively, while familiarity affects both of them, which eventually affect satisfactory and loyalty. At last, the paper provides suggestions contributing to the development of e-commerce enterprises and points out the deficiency and the direction of future research.

Trust is an issue that arises across the spectrum, albeit with different variants of goals and constraints. On the one end of the spectrum, legacy systems are characterized by function-based designs in which trust is an implicitly in-built concept -- the operation is historically designed, implemented, and optimized in a benign stance with respect to intended use. On the other end of the spectrum, modern systems are characterized by offerings from manufacturers, vendors, and system installers -- the devices and deployments use a variety of security features that offer promises of increased trust. All along this spectrum of cyber-physical systems, extending trust beyond the traditional cyber portions to the arteries that connect the physical portions to the cyber portions is a major challenge.

480	TrustSE	Multi-criterion Evaluation of Development Strategy Components in the Presence of Intangibles and Uncertainty	Regional development comprises a complex process. Therefore, its modelling requires application of appropriate tools. The tools have to be able to cope with diversity of issues including intangibility of utilised resources and obtained results, uncertainty with regard to available information, conflicts between different stakeholders etc. An approach for decision support with regard to sustainable development strategy components evaluation is introduced in the paper. It comprises combination of 3 components, namely: multi-criterion decision analysis, simulation and a concept of a game against nature. Each of the components makes it possible to address devoted sources of complexity. Due to computational requirements practical validation and utilisation of the approach is only possible using its software implementation. The implementation is still in development now. But preliminary results obtained for a sample problem of key development areas identification are encouraging.

481	TrustSE	Attack simulation based software protection assessment method	Software protection is an essential aspect of information security to withstand malicious activities on software, and preserving software assets. However, software developers still lacks a methodology for the assessment of the deployed protections. To solve these issues, we present a novel attack simulation based software protection assessment method to assess and compare various protection solutions. Our solution relies on Petri Nets to specify and visualize attack models, and we developed a Monte Carlo based approach to simulate attacking processes and to deal with uncertainty. Then, based on this simulation and estimation, a novel protection comparison model is proposed to compare different protection solutions. Lastly, our attack simulation based software protection assessment method is presented. We illustrate our method by means of a software protection assessment process to demonstrate that our approach can provide a suitable software protection assessment for developers and software companies.

482	TrustSE	(Do not) trust in ecosystems	In the context of Smart Ecosystems, systems engage in dynamic cooperation with other systems to achieve their goals. Expedient operation is only possible when all systems cooperate as expected. This requires a level of trust between the components of the ecosystem. New systems that join the ecosystem therefore first need to build up a level of trust. Humans derive trust from behavioral reputation in key situations. In Smart Ecosystems (SES), the reputation of a system or system component can also be based on observation of its behavior.In this paper, we introduce a method and a test platform that support virtual evaluation of decisions at runtime, thereby supporting trust building within SES. The key idea behind the platform is that it employs and evaluates Digital Twins, which are executable models of system components, to learn about component behavior in observed situations. The trust in the Digital Twin then builds up over time based on the behavioral compliance of the real system component with its Digital Twin. In this paper, we use the context of automotive ecosystems and examine the concepts for building up reputation on control algorithms of smart agents dynamically downloaded at runtime to individual autonomous vehicles within the ecosystem.	automotive;  building trust;  malicious behavior;  smart ecosystems;  virtual evaluation	Cioroaica, Emilia; Kuhn, Thomas; Buhnova, Barbora	ICSE-NIER '19: Proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Software Engineering: New Ideas and Emerging Results	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE-NIER.2019.00011		9-12	"@inproceedings{10.1109/ICSE-NIER.2019.00011,

483	TrustSE	Openness and requirements: Opportunities and tradeoffs in software ecosystems	A growing number of software systems is characterized by continuous evolution as well as by significant interdependence with other systems (e.g. services, apps). Such software ecosystems promise increased innovation power and support for consumer oriented software services at scale, and are characterized by a certain openness of their information flows. While such openness supports project and reputation management, it also brings some challenges to Requirements Engineering (RE) within the ecosystem. We report from a mixed-method study of IBM(r)'s CLM(r)ecosystem that uses an open commercial development model. We analyzed data from from interviews within several ecosystem actors, participatory observation, and software repositories, to describe the flow of product requirements information through the ecosystem, how the open communication paradigm in software ecosystems provides opportunities for `just-in-time' RE, as well as some of the challenges faced when traditional requirements engineering approaches are applied within such an ecosystem. More importantly, we discuss two tradeoffs brought about the openness in software ecosystems: i) allowing open, transparent communication while keeping intellectual property confidential within the ecosystem, and ii) having the ability to act globally on a long-term strategy while empowering product teams to act locally to answer end-users' context specific needs in a timely manner.

The study of developers' personalities has the potential of explaining their' behavior in various contexts. For example, the propensity to trust others, a critical factor to the success of global software engineering - has been found to influence positively the result of code reviews in distributed projects.In this paper, we perform a quantitative analysis of developers' personality in open source software projects, intended as an extreme form of distributed projects in which no single organization controls the project. We mine ecosystem-level data from the code commits and email messages contributed by the developers working on the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) projects, as representative of large scale-distributed projects.We find that developers become over time more conscientious, agreeable, and neurotic. Moreover, personality traits do not vary with their role, membership, and extent of contribution to the projects. We also find evidence that more open and more agreeable developers are more likely to become project contributors.1	team-building;  social and human aspects;  personality traits;  open source software;  large-scale distributed projects;  ecosystems;  apache	Calefato, Fabio; Iaffaldano, Giuseppe; Lanubile, Filippo; Vasilescu, Bogdan	ICGSE '18: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Global Software Engineering	https://doi.org/10.1145/3196369.3196372		92-101	"@inproceedings{10.1145/3196369.3196372,

Therefore, prior work focused on software quality and proposed many prediction models to identify the location of software bugs, to estimate their fixing-time, etc. However, one special type of severe bugs is blocking bugs. Blocking bugs are software bugs that prevent other bugs from being fixed. These blocking bugs may increase maintenance costs, reduce overall quality and delay the release of the software systems. In this paper, we study blocking-bugs in six open source projects and propose a model to predict them. Our goal is to help developers identify these blocking bugs early on. We collect the bug reports from the bug tracking systems of the projects, then we obtain 14 different factors related to, for example, the textual description of the bug, the location the bug is found in and the people involved with the bug. Based on these factors we build decision trees for each project to predict whether a bug will be a blocking bug or not. Then, we analyze these decision trees in order to determine which factors best indicate these blocking bugs. Our results show that our prediction models achieve F-measures of 15-42\%, which is a two- to four-fold improvement over the baseline random predictors. We also find that the most important factors in determining blocking bugs are the comment text, comment size, the number of developers in the CC list of the bug report and the reporter's experience. Our analysis shows that our models reduce the median time to identify a blocking bug by 3-18 days.

519	TrustSE	Multi-Value Models for Allocation of Software Component Development Costs Based on Trustworthiness	The trustworthiness of software is an important attribute. The cost of software development increases with its improvement by software trustworthiness. As one of main methods of software development, component-based software development can reduce development costs to a certain extent. However, it is important to study how to allocate the given development costs to each component so that software trustworthiness can be optimized. First, multi-value models for allocation of software component development costs are established based on different structures of software system. Second, algorithms for allocation of software component development costs can be designed by using dynamic programming. The proposed allocation algorithms can allocate development costs to each component to optimize software trustworthiness. Furthermore, in order to allocate development costs to each component automatically, a web-based software tool for allocating development costs to each component is developed. Finally, a case study of a self-service ticketing system is provided to show the feasibility of the proposed allocation algorithms.

521	TrustSE	Model Checking the Uncertainties in Software Systems Introduced by Intelligent Components	An intelligent software system consists of intelligent components, fundamentally modeled by neural networks and traditional software components, in which the intelligent components are responsible to make decisions. Thus, intelligent systems can adapt to environment changes in the running time. However, due to the fact that a neural network highly relies on the training data, its structure and quality are both uncertain. These uncertainties will be passed to the rest of the software system by the intelligent components. This paper presents a framework to model checking such kind of intelligent system software.

522	TrustSE	Designing Safety Critical Software Systems to Manage Inherent Uncertainty	Deploying machine learning algorithms in safety critical systems raises new challenges for system designers. The opaque nature of some algorithms together with the potentially large input space makes reasoning or formally proving safety difficult. In this paper, we argue that the inherent uncertainty that comes from using certain classes of machine learning algorithms can be mitigated through the development of software architecture design patterns. New or adapted patterns will allow faster roll out time for new technologies and decrease the negative impact machine learning components can have on safety critical systems. We outline the important safety challenges that machine learning algorithms raise and define three important directions for the development of new architectural patterns.

524	TrustSE	The Use of Multilegged Arguments to Increase Confidence in Safety Claims for Software-Based Systems: A Study Based on a BBN Analysis of an Idealized Example	"The work described here concerns the use of so-called multilegged arguments to support dependability claims about software-based systems. The informal justification for the use of multilegged arguments is similar to that used to support the use of multiversion software in pursuit of high reliability or safety. Just as a diverse 1-out-of-2 system might be expected to be more reliable than each of its two component versions, so might a two-legged argument be expected to give greater confidence in the correctness of a dependability claim (for example, a safety claim) than would either of the argument legs alone. Our intention here is to treat these argument structures formally, in particular, by presenting a formal probabilistic treatment of ""confidence,? which will be used as a measure of efficacy. This will enable claims for the efficacy of the multilegged approach to be made quantitatively, answering questions such as, ""How much extra confidence about a system's safety will I have if I add a verification argument leg to an argument leg based upon statistical testing?? For this initial study, we concentrate on a simplified and idealized example of a safety system in which interest centers upon a claim about the probability of failure on demand. Our approach is to build a ""Bayesian Belief Network? (BBN) model of a two-legged argument and manipulate this analytically via parameters that define its node probability tables. The aim here is to obtain greater insight than what is afforded by the more usual BBN treatment, which involves merely numerical manipulation. We show that the addition of a diverse second argument leg can indeed increase confidence in a dependability claim; in a reasonably plausible example, the doubt in the claim is reduced to one-third of the doubt present in the original single leg. However, we also show that there can be some unexpected and counterintuitive subtleties here; for example, an entirely supportive second leg can sometimes undermine an..."

527	TrustSE	Software quality: a market perspective	"The author investigates software quality in a market setting. He points out that imperfections in reputation place downward pressure on a product's price and lower the average quality of the delivered software. Testing, verification, and validation improve quality only when reputation is important to end users, when demand satiation is low, and when the marginal cost of improving quality is low in comparison with the improvement in quality. As firms improve total quality control, testing, verification, and validation become less relevant, until they may actually become counterproductive. Where complex products are produced, high quality may lower marginal costs of software, and this is shown to provide an accelerator effect that enhances other competitive strategies. Warranties can ameliorate the underprovision of quality by improving software reputation. But even with warranties, the authors shows that software developers will tend to underprovide quality.<

528	TrustSE	Early prediction of software component reliability	The ability to predict the reliability of a software system early in its development, e.g., during architectural design, can help to improve the system's quality in a cost-effective manner. Existing architecture-level reliability prediction approaches focus on system-level reliability and assume that the reliabilities of individual components are known. In general, this assumption is unreasonable, making component reliability prediction an important missing ingredient in the current literature. Early prediction of component reliability is a challenging problem because of many uncertainties associated with components under development. In this paper we address these challenges in developing a software component reliability prediction framework. We do this by exploiting architectural models and associated analysis techniques, stochastic modeling approaches, and information sources available early in the development lifecycle. We extensively evaluate our framework to illustrate its utility as an early reliability prediction approach.	modeling;  reliability prediction;  software architecture	Cheung, Leslie; Roshandel, Roshanak; Medvidovic, Nenad; Golubchik, Leana	ICSE '08: Proceedings of the 30th international conference on Software engineering	https://doi.org/10.1145/1368088.1368104		111-120	"@inproceedings{10.1145/1368088.1368104,

In this paper we present an approach for managing nontechnical requirements during COTS selection. The proposal is based on extending the ISO/IEC 9126-1 catalogue of quality factors by adding factors related to non-technical issues, obtaining a cohesive and comprehensive framework for managing requirements during selection.

533	TrustSE	A Common Terminology for Software Risk Management	In order to improve and sustain their competitiveness over time, organisations nowadays need to undertake different initiatives to adopt frameworks, models and standards that will allow them to align and improve their business processes. In spite of these efforts, organisations may still encounter governance and management problems. This is where Risk Management (RM) can play a major role, since its purpose is to contribute to the creation and preservation of value in the context of the organisation's processes. RM is a complex and subjective activity that requires experience and a high level of knowledge about risks, and it is for this reason that standardisation institutions and researchers have made great efforts to define initiatives to overcome these challenges. However, the RM field nevertheless presents a lack of uniformity in its terms and concepts, due to the different contexts and scopes of application, a situation that can generate ambiguities and misunderstandings. To address these issues, this paper aims to present an ontology called SRMO (Software Risk Management Ontology), which seeks to unify the terms and concepts associated with RM and provide an integrated and holistic view of risk. In doing so, the Pipeline framework has been applied in order to assure and verify the quality of the proposed ontology, and it has been implemented in Prot\'{e}g\'{e} and validated by means of competency questions. Three application scenarios of this ontology demonstrating their usefulness in the software engineering field are presented in this paper. We believe that this ontology can be useful for organisations that are interested in: (i) establishing an RM strategy from an integrated approach, (ii) defining the elements that help to identify risks and the criteria that support decision-making in risk assessment, and (iii) helping the involved stakeholders during the process of risk management.

In doing so, the Pipeline framework has been applied in order to assure and verify the quality of the proposed ontology, and it has been implemented in Prot\'{e}g\'{e} and validated by means of competency questions. Three application scenarios of this ontology demonstrating their usefulness in the software engineering field are presented in this paper. We believe that this ontology can be useful for organisations that are interested in: (i) establishing an RM strategy from an integrated approach, (ii) defining the elements that help to identify risks and the criteria that support decision-making in risk assessment, and (iii) helping the involved stakeholders during the process of risk management."",

536	TrustSE	Uncertainty-aware reliability analysis and optimization	Due to manufacturing tolerances and aging effects, future embedded systems have to cope with unreliable components. The intensity of such effects depends on uncertain aspects like environmental or usage conditions such that highly safety-critical systems are pessimistically designed for worst-case mission profiles. In this work, we propose to explicitly model the uncertain characteristics of system components, i. e. we model components using reliability functions with parameters distributed between a best and worst case. Since destructive effects like temperature may affect several components simultaneously (e. g. those in the same package), a correlation between uncertainties of components exists. The proposed uncertainty-aware method combines a formal analysis approach and a Monte Carlo simulation to consider uncertain characteristics and their different correlations. It delivers a holistic view on the system's reliability with best/worst/average-case behavior and also insights on variance and quantiles. But, existing optimization approaches typically assume design objectives to be single values or to follow a predefined distribution. As a remedy, we propose a dominance criterion for meta-heuristic optimization approaches like evolutionary algorithms that enables the comparison of system implementations with arbitrarily distributed characteristics. Our presented experimental results show that (a) the proposed analysis comes at low overhead while capturing existing uncertainties with sufficient accuracy, and (b) the optimization process is significantly enhanced when guiding the search process by additional aspects like variance and the 95\% quantile, delivering better system implementations as found by an uncertainty-oblivious optimization approach.

549	TrustSE	Recommendations to the Adoption of New Software Practices: A Case Study of Team Intention and Behavior in Three Software Companies	It is believed that people consider the implications of their actions and act based on a reasonable assessment of those implications. In this context, belief can be defined as a state of mind that embodies trust and confidence in something. So, behavior is driven by what is believed, by what is culturally assumed to be true about the world. Our work aims to study and characterize a belief system of software project teams to understand the beliefs underlying an intention or practice, and seek answers about how people progress from intention to behavior in software engineering environments. We applied a behavioral theory in terms of organizational and team level factors associated to beliefs about the software development practices. A set of interviews on origins, sources and impacts of beliefs on software practices was conducted with professionals from different project teams and companies. The results point out a strong influence of past experiences and repeated behavior on software development practices of project teams. Also, we list a set of practical recommendations for software companies that are dealing with the challenges of adopting new practices on software projects.

550	TrustSE	Using reputation stable analysis patterns as model based software reuse	Reputation is the opinion (more technically, a social evaluation) of the public towards a person, a group of people, or an organization. In other words, reputation is the general estimation that the public has for a person or an institution. It is an important factor in many fields, like business, online communities or social status. It is also a subject of study in social, management and technological sciences. Its influence may range from competitive settings like markets to cooperative ones like firms, organizations, institutions and communities. Furthermore, reputation also acts on different levels of agency, individual and supra-individual. At the supra-individual level, it concerns groups, communities, collectives and abstract social entities (such as firms, corporations, organizations, countries, cultures and even civilizations). It affects phenomena of different scale, from everyday life to relationships between nations. Reputation is a fundamental instrument of social order, based upon distributed, spontaneous social control. As can be seen, there is nothing different in the way reputation is handled in any of those areas of application. In fact, reputation is the same in all of them. Therefore, the reason for the analysis of this concept, with the sole purpose of extracting its core knowledge, it is a worthwhile reason, especially if you are planning to reuse it in numerous applications, while still maintaining a cost effective nature.

551	TrustSE	Improving the model development process: what use is model reuse: is there a crook at the end of the rainbow?	The emergence of new technologies in simulation modeling such as the World Wide Web has fostered debate on the reuse of models. In this paper we present a case for model reuse and the pot of gold that it promises. We then discuss model reuse from the viewpoint of simulation modelers who use COTS simulation packages and suggest that model reuse may in fact cost more than developing new models as candidates for reuse as trust must be established through thorough testing. An alternative to this is put forward that suggests that a Grab-and-Glue, Run, Reject, Reply (G<sup>2</sup> R<sup>3</sup>) approach is a more appropriate use of model reuse as it emphasizes the intellectual process of problem understanding rather than model correctness as an means to itself.

In an open-question survey we asked framework and library developers about their information needs with respect to both their upstream and downstream projects. We investigated what kind of information is required, why is it necessary, and how the developers obtain this information. The results show that the downstream needs are grouped into three categories roughly corresponding to the different stages in their relation with an upstream: selection, adoption, and co-evolution. The less numerous upstream needs are grouped into two categories: project statistics and code usage. The current practices part of the study shows that to satisfy many of these needs developers use non-specific tools and ad hoc methods. We believe that this is a largely unexplored area of research.

Although software-producing organizations are aware of the ecosystems in which they operate and their relationships with other ecosystem participants, all too often, vendors are unsuccessful in recognizing the potential value and role of such knowledge in their software ecosystems. This paper presents a classification of successful operational software ecosystem practices that may help software-producing organizations to effectively utilize and propagate knowledge of the in-the-field operation of their software, and therewith address challenges that result from ecosystem participation. Analysis of these practices confirms that infrastructures for acquisition, utilization and propagation of such knowledge, allow ecosystem participants to use the 'power of many' in increasing the quality and robustness of their software, and provide them with competitive advantage in terms of software quality, end-user satisfaction, ecosystem stability and ecosystem attractiveness.	ecosystem orchestration;  knowledge propagation;  software ecosystems;  software operation knowledge	van der Schuur, Henk; Jansen, Slinger; Brinkkemper, Sjaak	MEDES '11: Proceedings of the International Conference on Management of Emergent Digital EcoSystems	https://doi.org/10.1145/2077489.2077503		76-84	"@inproceedings{10.1145/2077489.2077503,
